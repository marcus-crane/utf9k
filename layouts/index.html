    <p>My name is <a href="/about/">Marcus Crane</a> and you’re currently logged on to my personal website.</p>
    <p>I maintain a <a href="/blog/">blog</a> and also keep a running lists of <a href="/questions/">questions</a> regarding topics I often want to remember things about for later.</p>
    <p>If you want to know what I’m up to, or realistically what I was up to like two weeks ago, there’s a <a href="/now/">page</a> for that.</p>
    <p>Finally, if you have any questions or just want to drop a comment, you can pick your poison over on my <a href="/contact/">contact</a> page.</p>
