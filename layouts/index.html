      <h3>Please excuse the mess!</h3>
      <p>I’ve just rolled out a decently sizable rewrite of my site so some things may still be a little messy.</p>
      <p>The bulk of it has rolled out but in an attempt to get the bulk of it out the door, I’ve decided to eject a little early.</p>
      <p>Realistically, I think it should be perfectly fine but if you do notice anything a little wonky, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:wonkiness@utf9k.net?subject=I%20noticed%20something%20a%20little%20off">wonkiness@utf9k.net</a></p>
      <p>For those interested, I’m maintaining a list so I don’t forget <a href="/todo/">here</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>My name is <a href="/about">Marcus Crane</a> and you’re currently logged on to my personal website.</p>
    <p>I maintain a <a href="/blog">blog</a> and also keep a running lists of <a href="/questions">questions</a> regarding topics I often want to remember things about for later.</p>
    <p>If you want to know what I’m up to, or realistically what I was up to like two weeks ago, there’s a <a href="/now">page</a> for that.</p>
    <p>Finally, if you have any questions or just want to drop a comment, you can pick your poison over on my <a href="/contact">contact</a> page.</p>
