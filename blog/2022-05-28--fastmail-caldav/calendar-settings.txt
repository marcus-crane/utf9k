The Calendars tab is highlighted in the left sidebar.
Three calendars are visible in the background with a modal open in the foreground.
The modal has two sections: One deals with exporting a calendar.
The other has a text box with the CalDAV URL for the selected calendar.
An arrow is pointing to the text box.
The contents of the textbox is highlighted up to the end of the segment containing the author's email.
