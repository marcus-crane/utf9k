In the vein of [Kepano](https://stephango.com/)'s [In good hands](https://stephango.com/in-good-hands), I've been thinking lately about the idea of "Entering the Machine" for lack of a better term.

When starting a new endeavour, the idea of it can be quite frightening and when it's something seemingly intense, it can be a worry that it might become this all-consuming voyage that you can't keep up on.

Once you embark, even if you feel like the dumbest person in the room, there's something quite relaxing about the idea that the voyage itself will mould you into the sort of person who might imagine would take on said voyage without a sweat.

In my head, I imagine it like entering a machine that'll chew you up and spit you out in a different form.

In that sense, it gives you permission to not apply so much pressure to yourself given there's always an external amount of pressure as it is. The difference is that your own applied pressure may not be as neutral and forgiving as the external type.
