Sometimes I'm reminded of why I become <span class="plural-magician">a magician</span> in the first place and that was to <span class="cast-spells">cast spells</span> to make life easier for myself and others.

As you get better at being <span class="plural-magician">a magician</span>, you get paid more which makes your time at work more valuable

Inevitably, you find yourself less and less able to <span class="magic">magic</span> away all of the little odds and ends that pop up, given that you're expected to prioritise your time on the big <span class="spells">spells</span> that will move the needle for the entire company.

This is true of every workplace and this isn't a post to say that there is anything wrong with this model!

Sometimes however, it's nice to go on little side quests and <span class="cast-spells">cast spells</span> for colleagues who aren't <span class="magicians">magicians</span>.

Seeing their eyes light up when you've managed to <span class="magic">magic</span> away hours of toil and pain reminds you why you're doing it all in the first place.

Where reasonable, I think every <span class="magician">magician</span> should carve out small slices of time to <span class="cast-spells">cast spells</span> for those who aren't equipped with the ability but of course, that assumes you have enough freedom and trust in your workplace to choose how you spend your time.
