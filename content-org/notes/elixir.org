Let's say we have the following module

#+begin_src elixir
defmodule Reminder do
  def alarm(time, day) do
  end
end
#+end_src

We can check what methods are on it by providing a :functions atom

#+begin_src
Reminder.__info__(:functions)
# [alarm: 2]
#+end_src

As we can see, this Reminder module has an alarm method, with an arity of 2.

* Output help documentation for a module

The iex interpreter includes a function called h which can be used to show documentation for a module

#+begin_src elixir
