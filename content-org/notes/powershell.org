* How can I view the methods associated with an object?

Let's say that you have a variable that contains a string:

#+begin_src powershell
$a = "abc"
#+end_src

That's neat but what if I want to view the possible methods that are available on the string object? You can use the Get-Member cmdlet. You can also use the shorthand version gm.

#+begin_src powershell
$a = "abc"
$a | gm
// Name | MemberType | Definition
// Clone | Method | System.Object Clone() [...]
// ...
// Length | Property | int Length {get;}
$a.Length
// 3
#+end_src

You can also view the static methods associated with an object too:

#+begin_src powershell
"abc" | gm - Static
// Compare | Method | static int Compare(string strA, string strB)...
#+end_src

* How can I perform a regex search?

You can check if a character contains a string by using the cmatch operator like so:

#+begin_src powershell
$word = "Hello"
$word -cmatch "[A-Z]"
// True
Search ActiveDirectory
#+end_src

Before you can query AD, you need to first import the Active Directory module

#+begin_src powershell
import-module activedirectory
#+end_src
