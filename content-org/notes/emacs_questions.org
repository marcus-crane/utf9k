Various questions I have about Emacs

* Why do some functions have double dashes?

As an example of what I mean, ~org-roam~ had seemingly the same function names at one point, despite the only difference being some double dashes

[[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/blob/ba835ef6242caf23e60ab9de1aaf1f25d7e5841f/org-roam-capture.el#L236][Here is an example of what I mean]]

At first glance, the naming differences between ~org-roam-capture--get-point~ and ~org-roam--capture-get-point~ seems completely arbitrary

Supposedly, since there is no such thing as internal vs external functions, it's a convention for declaring that a function should be considered private or internal only

https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/42286/double-hyphen-in-elisp-function-names

I still don't understand the above example since they both have double hyphens

* Why do some lists start with a backtick (~`~) instead of a comma (~'~)

One basically does list interpolation
