- There isn't a consensus on whether the tool should be used asyncronously or syncronously
- It can be tempting to be pulled into a thread in real time because otherwise it'll get buried in the river of noise
- Tendency for late additions to a thread to not hold as much weigh, unless it's a summarising message from someone with authority
- Feels like a lot of messaging is reactionary to things rather than considered due to the medium
- Probably needs to be an emphasis on long form
- No insight or feedback into the distraction caused by ~@here~, ~@channel~ or ~@team~ type of notifications
