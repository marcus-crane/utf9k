Hey there

I'm [[/about][Marcus Crane]], and this is my personal site

A lot of things are being moved around at the moment but you can still read my content

Blog posts live [[/blog][here]] and I've started uploading various notes [[/notes][here]]

The notes are a bit of a mess though so don't expect to gain too much from them

This site is currently powered by ~org-mode~ so if you're interested, the source code lives [[https://github.com/marcus-crane/utf9k][here]]

Lastly, I've got a [[https://nownownow.com/about][now]] page that you can find [[/now][here]]
