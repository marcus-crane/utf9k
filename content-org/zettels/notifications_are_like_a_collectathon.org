I think that the relief that comes from excessively clearing notifications is basically the same behaviour that drives people to enjoy [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectAThonPlatformer][Collectathons]]

Basically the driving side of [[file:notification_alcoholism.org][Notification Alcoholism]]

Perhaps that suggests clearing out notifications is a form of relief that I would compare to "escaping quicksand"
