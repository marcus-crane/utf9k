** Development tools
*** Editor

[[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] is my current [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] distribution of choice

I'm still relatively new to the ecosystem so if I find myself frustrated or want to make a quick edit, I'll generally reach for [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][VS Code]], [[https://www.sublimetext.com/][Sublime Text]] or [[https://neovim.io/][nvim]]

*** Terminal

- macOS: Terminal with minimal configuration
- Windows: Windows Terminal or stock Ubuntu WSL

I use stock [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell][zsh]] (not oh-my-zsh) with a profile that is shared across all of my development environments via Git

I'm looking at switching back to [[https://fishshell.com/][fish]] shortly and ideally having my configuration kept as a literate document ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Extracting-source-code.html][tangled]] by Emacs)

For both of my Windows environments, I do all of my development using version 2 of the [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq][Windows Subsystem for Linux]]
