    This was a request about Apple Carplay and Android Auto allegedly cutting out in the Tamaki Drive area, as
    well as some other locations. Radio Spectrum Management (RSM) had a look and weren't able to replicate the
    issue at all. They did also note that WiFi and Bluetooth call under a General User Radio License (GURL) so
    there has to be repeated reports for any given incident to cross the threshold for investigating. While the
    only claim about this issue is a single Reddit thread, and groups have known to mass-hallucinate events,
    it is an interesting story regardless. Personally I don't own a car so I wouldn't have any way of trying to
    replicate these issues but it does bring to mind a couple of cases where I've had Bluetooth earbuds glitch
    out, usually around the same areas. I had always put it down to a density issue so perhaps there could be
    heavier equipment at place. One Redditor claimed that CCTV backhaul and NZTA/AT traffic monitoring has been
    identified as being at play but didn't provide any evidence of those claims.

    There is a gaming community called Beehive Roleplay who roleplay as emergency services using FiveM, a
    multiplayer mod for Grand Theft Auto V running on dedicated servers. In order to have their simulation
    be as accurate as possible, in-game vehicles are branded with real-life branding such as those used by
    Fire and Emergency NZ (FENZ). At the time of the request, it seems that while FENZ had asked Beehive RP
    whether they had permission, a lot of it was still covered by legal privilege as to whether a cease
    and desist was filed.

    The actual request itself was not something I had ever considered, and the answer is zero deaths.
    However, what was interesting was the mention of the International Statistical Classification
    of Diseases and Related Health Problems. I had never heard of it before but it's essentially an
    index of all the different categories of death which each have a code assigned to them.

    This request is interesting, not so much for the content of the request itself but because
    the typesetting in the <a href="https://fyi.org.nz/request/20603/response/78529/attach/5/OIA2223%200239%20J%20Bruning%20Documents.pdf">attached slide deck</a>
    seems to break down as it progresses. See Page 71 as an example.

    A spreadsheet containing deployability percentages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Defence_Force">NZDF</a> personnel.
    I'd never really thought about it before now and probably would have found it believable that almost 100% of personnel would be deployable?
    It doesn't really break down what particular role each member has, which is probably a factor. I also wonder what differs between
    domestic and international deployability.

    A spreadsheet showing all of the various consultants hired by LINZ between 2017 and 2019.
    I'm not passing judgement on whether the list is a reasonable amount for an agency but
    just seeing the list laid out and all the various odd jobs that any given contractor
    may be hired for is quite interesting.

    An engagement survey showing how anaesthetic technicians feel about their
    workplace and career aspirations. I found this novel solely because it's so boring. It hadn't
    really occurred to me that medical professions might also have to deal with these sorts of HR surveys.

    At first, I had assumed was just a run of the mill reality TV complaint, only to discover
    it had formed part of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BossBabes#Controversy">investigation</a>
    which partly lead to Calida Stuart-Menteath
    <a href="https://www.nbr.co.nz/business/business-journalist-of-the-year/">winning Business Journalist of the Year</a> in 2019.
