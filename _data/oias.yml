    As it says on the tin, the longest period that someone has gone on their
    learner's license is over 40 years!

    The actual request itself was not something I had ever considered, and the answer is zero deaths.
    However, what was interesting was the mention of the International Statistical Classification
    of Diseases and Related Health Problems. I had never heard of it before but it's essentially an
    index of all the different categories of death which each have a code assigned to them.

    This request is interesting, not so much for the content of the request itself but because
    the typesetting in the <a href="https://fyi.org.nz/request/20603/response/78529/attach/5/OIA2223%200239%20J%20Bruning%20Documents.pdf">attached slide deck</a>
    seems to break down as it progresses. See Page 71 as an example.

- title: Deployability

    A spreadsheet containing deployability percentages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Defence_Force">NZDF</a> personnel.
    I'd never really thought about it before now and probably would have found it believable that almost 100% of personnel would be deployable?
    It doesn't really break down what particular role each member has, which is probably a factor. I also wonder what differs between
    domestic and international deployability.

  description: |
    A spreadsheet showing all of the various consultants hired by LINZ between 2017 and 2019.
    I'm not passing judgement on whether the list is a reasonable amount for an agency but
    just seeing the list laid out and all the various odd jobs that any given contractor
    may be hired for is quite interesting.

- title: Anaesthetic Technician engagement survey

  added: 2025-01-09
  description: |
    An engagement survey showing how anaesthetic technicians feel about their
    workplace and career aspirations. I found this novel solely because it's so boring. It hadn't
    really occurred to me that medical professions might also have to deal with these sorts of HR surveys.

    A request filed by myself, shedding some light on an age old question: Does pressing the
    button at the pedestrian crossing actually do anything?

    At first, I had assumed was just a run of the mill reality TV complaint, only to discover
    it had formed part of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BossBabes#Controversy">investigation</a>
    which partly lead to Calida Stuart-Menteath
    <a href="https://www.nbr.co.nz/business/business-journalist-of-the-year/">winning Business Journalist of the Year</a> in 2019.

    despite appearances, any units with a false floor are that way just due to aesthetics.
