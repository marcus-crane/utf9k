Here's what I'm up to currently:

## Nearly 6 months at Halter

Time has flown by and one element of Halter is that each day feels like two with the amount of stuff to learn as well as the speed that everything moves.

I was recently just on vacation and while it was just over a week, it felt like a month by the time I had returned which is quite nice as well.

Anyway, this is a bit of a double edged sword because there's so much stuff going on that I get an itch to work all the time, which also means I have a hard time deciding what to work on (and importantly, when to stop üòÖ)

## Post-Vacation slump

A couple of weeks back, I flew over to Perth for the first time to watch [WWE Crown Jewel 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewel_(2025)).

Having followed WWE on and off since I was about 12, it was a bit of a fever dream for me!

I *still* haven't sat down to watch the shows back but I do know that I'm very clearly immortalised into WWE Raw in one of the clips, being visible behind Seth Rollins as he's cutting a promo.

I don't imagine I'll have a holiday as interesting as that for quite some time unfortunately.

## Media Consumption

I feel like I have a pretty standard media consumption diet of the same weekly talk shows, podcasts, wrestling etc.

While I don't dislike any of them in particular but as far as a diet goes, a lot of it isn't actually that interesting so much as it's comfortable.

I'd like to make better use of where I spend my time and switch up my habits a bit to have a higher signal to noise ratio.

There's nothing wrong with consuming junk but some of the above is basically content that's pretty lossy when I could get higher quality stuff from the source (or go the other way and use a delayed aggregator to save a bunch of time and cruft)

## Science Adventure

Since the start of 2025, I've been slowly playing through the [Science Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Adventure) franchise.

There's a bit of a hole in my habits now as grinding through the main storyline had been my default for quite some time!

I don't regret spending the time, having really enjoyed Steins;Gate and Chaos;Child in particular.

It had also been my first real time spent with visual novels which I had attempted and fallen off of many times in the past so I definitely did not expect to conquer 6 1/2 VNs[^dash] in a year, let alone one.

[^dash]: I finished half of Robotics;Notes DaSH and put it aside (for now) after I realised it's actually closer to a side story
