Here's what I'm currently up to:

## 6 months at Halter

I wrote this 2 months ago and it's only true now!

I'm coming up to 7 months at the start of January but I feel like I'm in a time void or something. I've learnt so much in the latter half of this year that it feels like multiple years have passed at this point.

## Christmas Break

I've had a few smaller breaks here and there but this will be my first break longer than a week in quite some time I think.

The last time I had a multi-week shutdown over the holiday period must have been quite a number of years ago because it's a struggle to even recall when the last time was.

Admittedly, my worry is that I'm going to waste it all away scrolling so I aim to maximise the holiday period and churn through as many projects as I can!

## This Website

Every so often, I think I'll sit down and do a big redesign of the site. I've taken a few stabs and nothing in particular has stuck.

I've had a couple of comments that people like the site layout but I think it could have even more personality so perhaps I'll just focus on polishing various parts.

Some of the typography can do with a fresh pass and there are a number of pages on the site that aren't actually linked anywhere.

Surprisingly, I even have a few ideas for posts in my head as well so maybe I'll write one or two over the break.

It's an overcooked genre but I would like to capture my thoughts on the whole AI boom, not because I think I have any special insight but because I think it'd be interesting to revisit my thoughts when we're 5 or 10 years down the track, regardless of what the final outcome is.

I say that yet I almost never re-read my old posts so we'll see.

## NZCCL

It's not publicly mentioned yet[^1] but I joined the Executive Committee for the [New Zealand Council for Civil Liberties](https://nzccl.org.nz/) last month.

I had already been attending their monthly meetings and doing the odd bit of volunteer work so functionally, nothing changes there. I just get a fancy sounding title.

While I have some spare time over the holidays, I'll be aiming to read up on some of the upcoming legislation as well as doing some improvements on the tech side.

## RSS

I'm a fairly heavy user of [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com/) but it's time to do a prune.

There are some information sources I don't care about anymore, others I just don't seem to have as much time for so I'm going to try and min/max the noise to signal ratio once again.

The same goes for my article backlog. I end up with too much *stuff* that realistically I won't get around to.

## Framework

I recently got a 13 inch Framework for use at work. Until now, I'd been using a 13-inch Macbook Pro but I kept running out of memory as it *only* had 16GB of RAM.

This new upgraded Framework has plenty of resources and I was even able to run [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) on it to match my home desktop.

To date, I still haven't learned how to use tmux so perhaps it's finally time to take it for a spin.
