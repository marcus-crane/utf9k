Here's what I'm up to currently:

## Working at Halter

At the time of writing, I've just wrapped up my fifth week at [Halter](https://halterhq.com) which has been consuming a lot of my brain space in a good way.

Admittedly, I'm not the greatest at pacing myself when it comes to new problems so that's definitely something I'll be working on.

## Obsidian

I declared Obsidian bankruptcy earlier in the year and I've tried to organically land on a structure that is optimised for using as little thought power as I can manage for organising notes.

In short, all notes go in the root of my vault but I use backlinks to loosely create parent/child relationships where they make sense.

That sounds like a mess but I've been using the new Obsidian Bases functionality as a view layer for managing and organising those parent notes which is going alright so far.

I think this setup is pretty solid but I'm not rushing to backfill my historical notes in order to make sure it feels as sturdy as I hope.

## Links

At the moment, I maintain a [Linkding instance](https://links.soup.utf9k.net) which works well but it feels overkill for a list that essentially could just be a flat file.

I think I'd like to incorporate my link archive into my site when I do a redesign.

## Beeminder

After building up a bunch of goals in Beeminder, I found that a lot of my priorities and schedule changed in relation to my new job.

A lot of those goals were also just things that I didn't really find myself enjoying at all or they had slightly misaligned incentives so I archived a bunch of them.

That said, I'd like to introduce a couple more such as making sure that I touch my Obsidian vault most days.

## Website refresh

This one is always a long running thing where I say I'll do it yet never have any inspiration.

I went back through my sizable batch of website screenshots and got a few ideas that I'm going to ideally start experimenting with.

This time around, I'd like to make sure that my site is structurally sound in browsers without CSS so for example, no giant images and so on.

Historically I've done a good job with progressive JS but less so with CSS.

I don't strictly need to but I guess as someone who works as a Site Reliability Engineer, it's a nice challenge to come up with something aesthetically pleasing and yet performant and backwards compatible (within reason).

Being a frontender is not something I would able to do as a day job but I do like to be able to put my money where my mouth is in regards to web bloat.

## Media consumption

I got back into wrestling in a big way this year where I'd watch Raw and Smackdown weekly.

I don't regret it or anything but damn if it isn't a time sink (even with fast forwarding) and to make it worse, I think I might start watching AEW now after that great showing at AEW All In Texas.

Realistically, I might just have to watch the highlights and/or just start watching the PPVs because I only really watch promos for the weekly shows anyway.
