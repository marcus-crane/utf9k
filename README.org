This is my personal website, which is powered by [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]], [[https://orgmode.org/][orgmode]] and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]].

** Getting setup

Assuming you have golang and Hugo installed, you should only need to run ~hugo serve~ to start previewing the site

** Layout

Pages and posts live in ~content-org~ and are generated on the fly into the markdown files you see in ~content~

Following the preferred convention for ~ox-hugo~, and mainly to try something new, all of my blog posts exist in ~content-org/blog/posts.org~. Yes, it's one massive file, although I use orgmode to navigate around it quicker than having multiple small files.

HTML templates live in ~/layouts~

Images and other static content live in ~/static~

Deployment is handled automatically by [[https://www.netlify.com/][Netlify]]
