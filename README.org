This is my personal website, which is powered by [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] and org.

** Getting setup

Assuming you have golang and Hugo installed, you should only need to run ~hugo serve~ to start previewing the site

** Layout

Pages and posts live in ~content~

HTML templates live in ~layouts~

Images and other static content live in ~static~

Deployment is handled automatically by [[https://netlify.com][Netlify]]

** Conventions

As a reminder for myself, all files and posts consisting of more than one word should use a dash as a delimit eg; ~my-cool-post.org~ or ~nice-words.html~
