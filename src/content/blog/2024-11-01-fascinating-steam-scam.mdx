<Notice emoji="⚠️" title="Beware what you click on!">
This post contains screenshots for a phishing website.

I won't be typing out the URL but you can infer the site from the screenshots in this post of course.

While I encourage you to have fun poking around if you want, I'm not responsible if anything goes wrong!

Earlier today, I received a phishing attempt to try and steal my Steam account. It didn't work but I did think it was quite interesting!

I don't have the chat log handy but at some point, someone had sent me a friend request.

Most of the time, they're just people who are looking to do trade offers for some rare TF2 items that I have attached to my account and occasionally I'll accept their invites just for kicks.

At a glance however, this person didn't appear to be a trader so I figured I'd see why they sent me an invite.

In hindsight, the explicit mention about not doing any trading is probably a bit of reverse psychology since it's a fairly common issue on Steam so it defuses expectations that this request might be from a malicious user.

I had accepted their invite about 2 weeks ago and promptly forgot about it. They sent me a message about a week ago asking if I was busy, which I didn't reply to and then another earlier today asking if I had a second.

My default was still to assume there was some sort of catch here but I figured I'd humour them so I said "Sure, what's up?".

A bit unexpectedly, they said they had just created a logo for a friend's university esports team and wanted to know if I would give them feedback.

I've seen the "Can I show you something and get your feedback" format at least twice before, admittedly without understanding the payoff, but it seemed harmless enough.

They sent through this logo, which was supposedly made for an esports team at the [University of Exeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Exeter), who themselves do very much have a [real esports team](https://www.instagram.com/exeteresports) with their own logo.

This may have been their actual logo at some point but it seems to have changed since then if that was the case.

I said they did a good job and their next step was to ask me if I would vote for it in a competition.

At this point, I assumed I was talking to a university student who was going around, trying to farm upvotes for some competition which seemed harmless enough.

Normally I would bother but I had already gotten this far so I said, sure why not, assuming it would just be a simple button click.

They sent me a link for the following website.

This isn't the actual page they sent me just yet but we'll start with the homepage at work our way there.

At first glance, it all seems very above board.

There's some splashy Intel marketing at the top which makes you think that they have some sort of sponsorship deal going on.

It also has news posts that are all recent giving you the sense that this site is active. Upon closer inspection, you might note that all of the posts use relative days such as "2 days ago" which we'll come back to later on.

[ I'm going to write the rest of this post tomorrow because it's getting late but I'm hitting publish for now so Beeminder doesn't charge me! ]
