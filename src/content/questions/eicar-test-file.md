# EICAR test file

A fun little footnote in the world of [antivirus](antivirus.md) software testing.

It's a file that has been designated a virus in order to test out malware scanners and the like although the file is perfectly harmless.

It can cause some fun such as triggering antivirus via CCTV if the camera is set up to read QR codes that happen to contain the EICAR test string.

You can find more at [the official EICAR website](https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950).
