Videogame perfection. Move over Dork Souls because we have a new contender for world's hardest game. Take all of the most minute, irrelevant details from across 236 episodes of Friends, compact it all into a single trivia game and the result is Friends: The One With All The Trivia.

This game does not hold your hand. The second you hit Start, sit back because you're about to endure a barrage of over 3000 questions and 700 video clips. Your hosts Janice, Gunther and Jack & Judy Geller accompany you on the tour letting out small jeers when you inevitably mess up. As someone who has never seen an episode of Friends, it felt like a trip into hell itself.

Once you choose a mode, which are essentially all the same I might add, then get ready to stare at the same boring apartment building. I can only assume it's where the cast of the show live but I have absolutely no idea. As you'd expect, the gameplay is very basic. Questions appear on screen, accompanied by a host of annoying voice overs.

Each possible answer is mapped to a button but in true programming mastery, no one thought it'd be a good idea to arrange the answers into a diamond shape to match the face buttons. I guess the developers just thought it'd be too forgiving to let the player quickly understand what button does what at a glance.

The true torture is in the little progress bar at the bottom of the screen. If you answer correctly, one slot lights up. If you're wrong, a point is subtracted, assuming you even managed to get one in the first place. I can't stress hard enough that this game does not end until you have achieved 5 answers right in a row. It won't let you leave. In fact, as I write this, it's been about 6 weeks and I'm still trapped playing this shitty game.

Still itching to get that Friends fix? Try checking out the official website for the game. You can test your knowledge on each daily question. Yes, it's still updated daily despite the game having released 10 years ago.
