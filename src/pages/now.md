## Experimenting with Enveloppe

I discovered this great plugin called [Enveloppe](https://github.com/Enveloppe/obsidian-enveloppe) for Obsidian that lets my sync pages from Obsidian to Github.

This very update you're reading was shared using it!

It's great because it means I can publish with much less friction while still keeping the benefits of a static site and a basic workflow.
