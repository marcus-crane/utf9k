## Recovering from being sick

Top of the list is that I've been slowly recovering from winter sickness.

It sucks!

My main symptom is having what feels like a big ball of phlegm in my throat which is extremely uncomfortable.

Thankfully it doesn't impair my breathing at all but at first, I genuinely thought there was a risk of it üò±

It's mostly under control though although it comes and goes.

Personally, I'd rather take a runny nose and a cough over this anytime.

## Weekly Reviews

I've been doing the Weekly Review ritual for quite a while now and I don't really know how I feel about it.

Occasionally I'd take breaks and come back to it, and this year has been my longest streak yet but realistically, most of mine are just saying "Everything was fine" and "I guess I should try to do more?".

It's really just become a ritual for the sake of the ritual.

It's also more of a retroactive thing so instead, I'm just going to invert it with what I've called a Weekly Forecast.

Not unlike the weather, I just write down what I aim to focus on and then I write down whatever thoughts I have about how it went at the end of the week.

Beats me how it'll go as I only came up with the idea yesterday but it maybe more accurately fits the idea that not unlike the weather, you can maybe guess what it'll contain but often it's completely unexpected.

Something something a thousand tiny nudges instead of trying to shift an oil tanker entirely and all that.

## Videogames

Now that [Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/) is out, I've gotten back on the horse to finish off the post-6.x expansion content since I never progressed through the patches after finishing the Endwalker main story.

I've also been replaying [Just Cause 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Cause_3) which is just as fun as I remember.

Even better, it's what I like to call a shopping list game meaning that I can check off everything that needs doing, usually while watching through some also-low effort TV series on the side.
