**New Year, Same Me**

Time flies and 2024 is already upon us!

I swear I say it every year but 2024 sounds like such a futuristic number.

After a quiet first half of 2023, I ended up producing a couple of blog posts towards the end of 2023 and have even set myself a goal using [Beeminder](https://beeminder.com) to write at least one a month.

My default is a bit of a paradox where I'll not write because I think I need to spend time to make something quality, only to churn out text in one sitting until I get bored and then just hit publish without doing any further edits or reviews.

As the old [clay analogy](https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/) goes, I'm better off making more posts and letting that result in quality than purely aiming for quality itself.

Maybe I'm already doing that though, just on a slowish timeline given I've already written a bunch of posts for the last few years.

**Site Design**

I recently moved my site from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to [Astro](https://astro.build/) as more of a middle ground to add some fun to my site.

While my previous Hugo iteration had some progressive Javascript, it always felt a little stricter than I would like around Javascript tooling.

I still stand by the idea that most things should be static by default, and that will continue to be true but a little leeway around things like MDX are nice.

Interestingly, I was a bit sour on the idea of MDX for a long time but after some thought and experimentation, I realised that using shortcodes within Markdown is really no different if you squint.

There are some questions I have around syntax support (ie; would IA Writer consider `.mdx` to be a non-markdown file?) but I've written that much Markdown over the years that I'm not too worried. I rarely use stuff like header collapsing and other features.

I'd like to freshen up my site a little bit this year to make it stand out a bit more, homepage live player aside which is my pride and joy :')

Maybe my next post will finally be writing about how it all works on a technical level since it's evolved quite a bit over the years
