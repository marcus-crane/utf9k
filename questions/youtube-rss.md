title: How can I subscribe to a YouTube channel with an RSS reader?
---
All YouTube channels have an RSS feed which can be found at the following endpoint:

```
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<channel_id>
```

In order to get a user's channel ID, you just need to navigate to `About`, click the Share icon on the right sidebar and then hit `Copy channel ID

I've used this for years myself over having a YouTube account and it's nice.
