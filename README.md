This is my personal website, which is powered by [Zola]() and [Commonmark Markdown]().

## Getting setup

## Layout

Pages and posts live in `content`

HTML templates live in `layouts`

Images and other static content lives in `static` (for now)

Deployment is handled automatically to a cheap [Vultr](https://vultr.com/) server using Github Actions

# Conventions
