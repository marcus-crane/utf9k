This is my personal website, which is powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org).

## Getting setup

To get started, you'll want to install Zola using one of the variety of [officially supported installation methods](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)

Once you've got the `zola` binary, you should just be able to run `zola serve --open` to open my site in your browser

## Layout

Pages and posts live in `content`

HTML templates live in `layouts`

Images and other static content lives in `static` (for now)

Deployment is handled automatically to a cheap [Vultr](https://vultr.com/) server using Github Actions

# Conventions

TBA
