This is my personal website, which is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Getting setup

Assuming you have golang and Hugo installed, you should only need to run ~hugo serve~ to start previewing the site

## Layout

Pages and posts live in `content`

HTML templates live in `layouts`

Images and other static content live in `static`

Deployment is handled automatically by [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
