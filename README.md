# utf9k

The content files that make up my personal site: [https://utf9k.net](https://utf9k.net)

## Prerequisites

The only thing you'll need to install is [hugo](https://gohugo.io), the static site generator that I use to build my site.

[This guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) should step you through everything you need to get setup.

## Deployment

I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which automatically builds and deploys any changes pushed to the master branch of Github.

It also allows split deployments, so if a pull request is created, it'll deploy a version separate from my main deployment. It makes previewing the changes easier and also helps avoid pushing a breaking deployment.
