I currently work at [Lightspeed](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/) on our X-Series product, formerly known as [Vend](https://www.vendhq.com/nz/).

In particular, I'm a Senior [Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) technically based out of our office in [Newmarket, New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmarket,_New_Zealand) although I generally work remote most days.

As of late, I've been doing a bunch of work around [Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage) both internally and also providing some open source contributions back to the community.

Maybe I should mention that we're hiring so if anything on this website seems interesting to you, you should [come and work on cool stuff with us](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/careers/openings/?office=new-zealand)!

I dunno, I'm not paid to say that and technically it's just more work for me because I probably will have to do interviews ðŸ˜…
