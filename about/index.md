I never write as much as I wish I would but there's a handful of articles you can read.

I currently work at [Lightspeed](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/), particularly working on [Vend](https://www.vendhq.com/nz/).

In particular, I'm a Senior [Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) technically based out of our office in [Newmarket, New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmarket,_New_Zealand) although I generally work remote most days.
