For the unaware, this is inspired by the [/uses](https://uses.tech) page idea

## Text Editor

For most things, I reach for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I use a couple plugins for extra syntax highlighting but that's about it.

When it comes to quick edits, I'll often pop open Neovim with a default [Lunarvim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) configuration. I don't know any shortcuts besides moving around, deleting/pasting lines and existing.

Sometimes I'll reach for [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) when it comes to large files or just wanting a scratchpad. I actually did buy a license!

## Terminal

Currently, I use [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) with [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#jetbrainsmono) 12pt and the [Catppuccin Macchiato](https://github.com/catppuccin/ghostty) colour scheme.

Everything else is stock and unconfigured.

## Computers

- Macbook Air M1 as my personal laptop
- Custom built desktop running Windows 11 for games
  - It used to run [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) but I would end up programming instead of playing games.
  - For the most part, I just use a standard Xbox One controller with it.
  I have some Razer mouse I got a while back but I don't use any of the features.
- I use a [Dygma Defy](https://dygma.com/pages/defy) with a [Logitech MX Vertical](https://www.logitech.com/en-nz/shop/p/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse) at work.
