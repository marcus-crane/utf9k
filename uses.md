For the unaware, this is inspired by the [/uses](https://uses.tech) page idea

## Text Editor

I flip flop a lot in this area.

For most things, I reach for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which I had set up at some point but my configuration was nuked server-side a while back and I haven't bothered to configure anything beyond some basic language plugins.

When I need to view extremely large files or I just want to do a quick edit, I'll often reach for [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) although it's just using the stock configuration.

## Terminal

Currently, I use [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) with [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#jetbrainsmono) 12pt and the [Catppuccin Macchiato](https://github.com/catppuccin/ghostty) colour scheme.

Everything else is stock and unconfigured.

## Computers

- Macbook Air M1 as my personal laptop
- Custom built desktop running [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) for games

## Applications

- [1Password](https://1password.com/) for password management
- [Book Tracker](https://booktrack.app/) for tracking reading progress
- [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com/) for email and calendaring
- [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) for browsing
- [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com/) for low-signal RSS feeds
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for notes
- [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com) for podcasts
- [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) for capturing things to read later (emails, articles, PDFs etc)
