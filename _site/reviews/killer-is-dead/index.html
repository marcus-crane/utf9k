            This was <strong>perhaps one of the most nonsensical games that I have played in a long time</strong>. The
            story, for the most part, was barely comprehensible and even after having finished it, I still don’t
            understand a lot of what happened!
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, personally, I like nonsensical things so, for me at least, this wasn’t a huge issue.
            <strong
              >If what you’re looking for is a good story however, I would say that this really isn’t really the game
              for you</strong
            >. If you’re here for something along the lines of DMC or are just a
            <strong>general action game fan</strong> who is after an extensive combo system with flashy tricks, then
            sorry but <strong>you’ll just think this game is garbage tier when judged on its combat</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, as I’ve half explained already, it’s a <strong>third person hack and slash title</strong> which is
            mainly just a button masher when it comes to fighting. You’ve got your basic slashes as well as your strange
            mechanical arm which can take various forms such as a gun or a giant mace thing. It all sounds very
            interesting but I never really used them as I felt just basic sword attacks did much more damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s an <strong>upgrade system outside of battles which is pretty much what you’d expect</strong>, just
            damage upgrades and new moves. Health upgrades come in the form of little diamonds that drop from defeated
            enemies and once you collect enough, you gain an extra health slot. The same is said for your ability meter
            which is upgraded through roses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hmm, what else. Oh! How could I forget to mention the <strong>art style</strong>! At first, I found it kind
            of a big odd, it reminded me of when you look at a TV or monitor from above or below and the colours are all
            messed up. It did grow on me after a while though. There was also a
            <strong>bit of an outcry over a mode where you stare at a woman’s bits</strong> when she wasn’t looking,
            while on a date with her but
            <strong>I thought it was pretty boring to be honest so I just skipped it</strong>. They’re just classed as
            <strong>optional</strong> missions outside of the story mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, yeah! <strong>Not really feeling it hugely in terms of recommending the game</strong> but if you
            just want a straight forward hack and slash, <strong>it’s decent if you can pick it up for cheap</strong>.
            Otherwise, it’s just in the middle really. <strong>It’s just <em>alright</em></strong
            >.
