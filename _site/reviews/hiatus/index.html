          <p>Nope, it’s not a game but rather, an announcement!</p>
          <p>
            Sadly, since I’ve been rather busy at my new job, which has way more hours in the week than my previous one,
            I haven’t had much time at all to play anything let alone even do last weekend’s post.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still intend to bring the site back at some point. I’ve started porting over the site to a nice CMS after
            it was sitting on the backburner for a while and once that’s all done and working, I hope to build on top of
            it adding some new features. Nothing huge but generally just making the site more user friendly for those
            who would like to sort by platform when looking for something to play.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’d also like to add a few more details to the article page such as cover art and bring the release date and
            publisher information up to the top of the page but only if I can do it without being intrusive.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m still not exactly sure how many readers there are at present. To date, since October, the site has
            apparently had a total of 1,623 page views which is well beyond anything I ever expected. That said, page
            views don’t give any indication of unique visitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interestingly, there’s regularly a visitor or two who access the site via the
            <a href="/reviews/asuras-wrath">Asura’s Wrath</a> article. If you do an image search for Asura’s Wrath, it
            shows up as the 5th image, for me at least. How that happened, I have no idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            As always and perhaps now more than ever, if you have any comments, suggestions or feature requests, I can’t
            promise anything but I’ll consider anything put forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site will still stay up but until then, for any updates, you can find the site on Twitter here or you
            can find me, the one who writes and maintains this entire side project
            <a href="https://twitter.com/sentreh">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To those who have accessed the site, whether once or many times, or even anyone visiting for the first time,
            I’d like to say thanks for your interest! It’s all very much appreciated.
