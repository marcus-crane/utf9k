            Quite a few years ago, I found myself sitting outside of a cafe. I was staring across the street at a
            carpark and noticed that every so often,
            <a
              href="https://www.google.com/maps/@-36.8647825,174.7607181,3a,75y,78.37h,86.35t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJuwWzp4GFW4TPKe0zlGP1A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu"
              >a tow truck would pull in, towing a car behind it.</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is perfectly normal of course but after a few of these, it occurred to me that it might be interesting
            to see what that looks like from a birds eye view. Surely it would look like some of kind of stream where
            the towing yard is a hot spot with tentacles sprawling out all over the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took me quite a few years but I managed to go from this idea to a simulation that shows 3 years worth of
            vehicles, represented as orange lines, flowing throughout the city to their final destination.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can't just pluck out where a vehicle was picked up and taken to because that makes a straight line. To
            have the full effect, you need to figure out a likely route for every single instance and then plot a line
            across all of the streets in between for your simulated vehicle to follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm pretty proud of the final result which is probably one of the more advanced side projects I've put
            together, considering it started with a big messy spreadsheet and ended up with an interactive
            visualisation.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can play around with the project just below but if you'd like to see a full screen version, or you have
            iframes disabled, then you can <a href="https://towing.utf9k.net">check it out here</a>.

            If you'd like to read a detailed write-up on how this was made, or follow along with creating your own
            version, you can find those details in <a href="/blog/spreadsheet-to-visualisation">this blog post</a>.
