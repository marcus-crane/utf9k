            I'm a user of <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a> which is a service that allows you to import all
            sorts of highlights from books and <a href="https://readwise.io/read">articles</a> through to tweets and

            There is unofficial official support for Kindle and iBooks, by which I mean Readwise supports those sources
            but they are still not officially sanctioned (or known!) by Amazon and Apple respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kobo, which is the primary competitor to Kindle, has lots of nice eReaders but historically Readwise has had
            no support for them as they don't have a web UI to scrape.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other part of the problem is that getting your highlights off of your device is very fiddly for
            technical users, and nigh-on-impossible for non-technical users as it requires performing SQL queries
            against a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where October comes in. It was created primarily to scratch my own itch. While I'm perfectly capable
            of extracting highlights from my device, I also aspire to do as little work as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            This first version is very sparse and gives the user very little option besides syncing their highlights. It
            works well for myself, and has helped a few users but it doesn't provide much ability to introspect the
            upload process or control eg; which books are uploaded.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've begun work on a rewrite from the ground up which provides more control and insight to the end user.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time of writing, October is promoted within Readwise itself as the only option for uploading Kobo
            highlights. Previously, the Readwise team had released an integration for uploading store-bought highlights
            via Kobo APIs but this was unfortunately shut down.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a technical level, October is comprised of a <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> frontend with the
            backend being powered by <a href="https://wails.io/">Wails</a>, a relatively new Golang framework for
            creating applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the React frontend is bundled up into minimised HTML, this results in October weighing in at a measly 12
            megabytes.
          </p>

            It features a Windows build, a fully code signed macOS version and a Linux version works experimentally<sup

            Funnily enough, most of the reading I have done over the duration of this project has been making random
            highlights as a pseudo-integration test.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I look at things from a big picture view, I would probably read a lot more if I just deleted this project
            and resorted to manually uploading my highlights!

                  There are lots of comments that I want to make notes on but Readwise doesn't support importing these.
                  It makes sense of course since every website layout is arbitrary but to scratch my own itch, I made a
                  Chrome extension that sends Hacker News and Reddit comments to Readwise.

                  You're welcome to compile it if this is useful to you! I haven't looked into distribution and
                  packaging plus last I checked, Linux support for Wails was solid but technically still marked as
                  experimental.
