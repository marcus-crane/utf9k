          <h1>Why did oil futures go negative in April 2020?</h1>
        </header>
        <div id="post-body">
          <p>
            On April 20th 2020, oil futures fell to $-37.63 per barrel but how is that possible? That would suggest
            people are literally paying customers to take oil off their hands.
          </p>
          <p>In a sense, that's exactly the case but perhaps not for quite the reasons you might expect.</p>
          <h2 id="what-are-oil-futures">
            <a aria-hidden="true" class="jumplink" tabindex="-1" href="#what-are-oil-futures">¶ </a>What are oil
            futures?
          </h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              with the pandemic bringing the economy to a standstill, there is so much unused oil sloshing around that
              American energy companies have run out of room to store it. And if there’s no place to put the oil, no one
              wants a crude contract that is about to come due.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In reality, traders hold a contract that, generally after about 3 months, is translated into a physical
            delivery of oil.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, someone may pay $40 per barrel in January. Oil may be worth $60 in March so a trader might then
            sell the contract for a $20 profit, as I understand it anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            Futures are designed for people who actually want to purchase oil, or any future-able item like wheat, corn
            and so on.
          </p>
          <p>That doesn't stop a whole portion of Wall Street who speculate on these futures however.</p>
          <p>
            There are some funny stories about junior traders who have forgotten to sell their contract and have been
            required to take delivery of hundreds of physical barrels of oil.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing,_Oklahoma">Cushing, Oklahoma</a> is called the
            "Pipeline Crossroads of the World" and is where a great deal of oil is stored in the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to oil futures, Cushing is also the one and only
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing,_Oklahoma#Oil_futures_designated_delivery_point_in_the_US"
              >designated delivery point</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally, oil is stored there on behalf of those who lease between 50 - 80 million barrels worth of storage.
          </p>

            <a aria-hidden="true" class="jumplink" tabindex="-1" href="#why-did-oil-futures-turn-negative">¶ </a>Why did
            oil futures turn negative?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Given Coronavirus meant that most of the world was at home, oil producers had little option but to store
            their oil.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it came time for those futures to convert into physical oil, there was no actual storage left for
            traders to purchase.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              With nowhere to store their oil, and the foreboding promise of exorbitant storage fees at the delivery
              site, the holders of oil delivery contracts were forced to pay buyers with oil storage contracts to take
              the product off their hands, upending the market and sending the entire industry into unknown, negative
              territory.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Faced with the horrifying idea of having to drive all the way to Cushing, Oklahoma to somehow receive
            thousands of barrels of oil, it became more appeals to just pay almost $40/barrel for someone else to take
            the future (and impending delivery) off of their hands
          </p>
          <p>
            Storage may have been possible but at a time where it was in high demand, the excesses would have been
            astronomical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not to mention, there was already an overabundance of oil for the foreseeable future so it would take a long
            time to realise a profit, if at all.
