          <p>
            This post has been a long time coming because I've never really known how to express it. I'm not even sure I
            can write it properly anyway but I'm going to at least try.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recently started the Xero Graduate Programme which has been amazing! As with any new position, it
            inevitably involves meeting a lot of new people for the first time. I'm not really here to talk about the
            program itself which is a story for another time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm purely talking about my own experiences struggling to interact with people properly. I figure by writing
            about it, even if I should fail to improve as a result, you'll at least have an insight to how some people
            struggle with this kinda stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            I often feel like I'm stuck in a recurring loop where I'll meet someone that I consider to be not only
            interesting, but worth knowing, and so I decide "I'd like to know more about this person". I mean, we all do
            it but the more I consider my past approaches, I've realised that I was digging for lore first, rather than
            getting to properly know the person.
          </p>
          <p>
            What do I mean? Well, let me take a step back and explain what lore is. It's a term that is found commonly
            in fictional universes such as TV series, games, comics, movies and so on. If the story and character
            progression of a TV series is the plot, then lore is the mythos of the characters and its world. Past
            battles, heroic struggles, craters left where cities once stood, ancient texts left by those past and so on.
            Obviously I'm not suggesting that your average person is supposed to be some kind of otherworldly being but
            the point is, humans don't have lore tabs.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I mean is that you can't, and shouldn't, be able to just learn about someone in an instant. Game of
            Thrones is likely a popular example of this. I haven't watched it but I know that if I were to start, I
            could pour over its wiki and spend hours learning about cities, people, kingdoms, tribes and so on. For
            years, humans have been fascinated by good stories and lore, no matter the medium it takes, is probably the
            purest concentration of stories past.
          </p>
          <p>
            Actual humans - living people - may have good stories and interesting tales but you can't just skip to the
            last page and find out what happens to your favourite character. At some point, you might consider learning
            a lot about someone would make you a better friend because you can understand their nuances. Learning what
            makes them tick may allow you to adapt but friendships aren't the result of studying someone's past. Funnily
            enough, they're the result of being a part of someone's past, which can only be done by being in the
            present. Ironic since it's almost putting the two backwards but in a sense, that's what I had been doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            What leads someone to think like that? I've been mulling over this lately because almost all of us act out
            the same pattern to an extent. Biographies, literally the story of others, are a popular book category while
            Wikipedia has detailed articles on any celebrity you can imagine. They're still people too like you and me
            so where do you draw the line? Heck, the sheer scale of public information shared by society makes it easier
            than ever before to scope out someone's past. We're the most documented group of humans in history,
            essentially recording our autobiographies in real time. The only deciding factor I can up with has to be
            intent.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not what it used to be but I remembered a post from Lifehacker that I read back when, geez, I must've
            been about 14 at the time? The author was talking about Last.FM. The short of it is that you can "scrobble"
            music you listen to. It just records a song as listened to once you've hit, say 80% of the song played. Over
            time, you can view a history of your favourite artists, get recommendations and generally just share your
            taste in music. The post was talking about the Last.FM service, and specifically how the author had noted
            their friend would scrobble happy tracks on a good day and vice versa when things were looking bleak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their friend was inadvertently letting on to how they truly felt without possibly giving it a second
            thought. I couldn't track down the original post which is probably long gone but the author noted how it
            enabled them to be a better friend to an extent. I'm fairly certain that was actually the day I signed up
            for the service and I still use it to this day. Spotify and other popular services still have native
            integrations built into their clients. Perhaps it's obvious but the same never happened for me. Who could
            expect such a thing with so much content floating around. Even if someone did have a look, you'd have to be
            consciously looking for patterns anyway. If I can't be lucky enough to have someone who thinks like that,
            surely I can be that person for someone else, right? The intention is good so what could go wrong?
          </p>
          <p>
            Like most things that get out of hand, this all started small and with the best of intentions. I've got two
            past examples that quickly spiraled in different directions. I'll leave them up for you to decide what's
            good, bad and in between. Sometimes things are never so clear cut, especially in the moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I once was getting ready for a date and I was quite excited! It's not often that I set them up and when I
            do, I try to put in my best efforts. I was stood up and left very confused. Not only that, I was blocked on
            every conceivable platform for no obvious reason. I know it's often said but I genuinely didn't get it. I
            should've shrugged it off but it kept eating away at me until I decided I needed to find out just to get
            over it. Back to what I said about biographies, she'd had a YouTube channel with a public view history.
            Roughly 30% of the views she watched were themed around dealing with anxiety. Part of me wish I had known
            that earlier so I could have been more accomodating if that's what she needed but context matters. Here was
            a relative stranger that I have no right to know any more than she lets on personally. I still feel bad for
            her honestly even though I was the one who got burnt. Were they bad actions to take even though they had
            good intentions? I honestly can't say.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was scrolling my timeline one night and came across a tweet from a teenager. He'd claimed to have just
            swallowed an entire bottle of medicine in a suicide attempt that he desperately wanted to undo. Rounding up
            an online acquaintance, we put our cursed skills to work as quick as we could. From little more than a
            username, we narrowed him down to a first name, nationality, gender, age estimate and state. Unfortunately
            it wasn't enough specific enough that any authorities would be able to put it to use but he did end up
            surviving. I had previously sent him a message reassuring him since he'd disappeared offline but I never got
            a response.
          </p>
          <p>
            He's still active to this day I believe but understandably, two strangers digging up your information can be
            disconcering no matter the circumstance. I still feel bad about the situation, despite the outcome. As you
            comb through those forum posts, abandoned IRC logs and tweets, you begin to feel like you understand the
            person. You can almost picture how they're thinking by what they say, and even more crucially, what they
            don't. It's like you know the person for a brief moment only to remember it's a one way screen and they
            could give less of a shit about you despite the attempt. Good actions? Good intent? What's the difference?
            They're essentially the same story, right but they feel different.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, what's the point of this little exercise, and this post as a whole? The big picture of it is that
            realistically, what I've just described is a problem. I often have a problem with getting to properly know
            people. I'm great at learning who someone is but generally at a distance. If a group of friends are the main
            cast, I'm one of the extras in the background. Honestly, I probably don't think I'm worthy enough to be
            promoted to a main character in this scenario because I often struggle to see it happening. I was recently
            at a meetup and I felt painfully like the odd one out. You can almost read the indifference in some people's
            face when you talk to them. If I've learnt anything over the last few years, it's that I think I'll always
            cope better being picky with this sort of stuff. Sometimes I try to be friendly and seemingly the other
            party gets the wrong impression that I have some kind of motive. To steal a quote from Wargames, it often
            feels like the only winning move is not to play.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you've ever read Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, then good on you because I
            haven't. In the book, he comes to the conclusion that for others to take a genuine interest in you, it takes
            little more than being interested in them. The more you ask questions of others, the more interesting they
            will apparently find you. Perhaps it's true, I couldn't say but lately I feel like mystery might be a common
            thread. Looking back, some of the more interesting people I've met have been quite illusive. That is to say,
            they're never around. At that point, I have to wonder though if it's the absence generates the mystery or if
            being a wanted person generates the absence. Perhaps one feeds the other and the secret is to just not give
            a shit and purposely be unavailable. Just rarely look at notifications and struggle to keep appointments.
            Slowly disappear from view until you're all but forgotten. I'm joking of course but I wonder if there's
            something to be learnt from those people.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, what have we learnt? Well, I've basically admitted that I may or may not be an awful person
            depending on how you've felt after taking this lengthy journey. Odds are that you've already made up your
            mind well before now if we've met before. Hopefully you've gained some insight into the meta of dealing with
            other people. I suppose this kind of thing comes naturally but I feel like I missed a memo somewhere. Either
            way, the first step is admitting something is wrong. Once you do that, hopefully it should be more
            straightfoward to progress and become a better person. Perhaps you can let me know how I get on?
