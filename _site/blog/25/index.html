          <p>
            It's 6:30pm on my 25th birthday and I've been reflecting a bit on what I've managed to accomplish so far.
            While this isn't a post about that, there's no better time to assess the state of my personal site and where
            I'd like to go forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            At present, my blog isn't really best effort. I'd like to write more things but I never really make it an
            actual goal. I'd say the biggest reason is that I've been wrapped up in work side projects instead of my own
            personal side projects so I'll be looking to stop doing that.
          </p>
          <p>
            My site has gone through plenty of iterations, with the current being a static site, built with Hugo and
            hosted on Netlify. It works but it's not exactly how I'd like it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along the way, pages have disappeared. There used to be a projects page which never got filled in properly.
            There was also an archive of reviews I wrote years back. They're still there but not publically exposed
            anywhere.

          <p>
            I always seem to fumble around a lot with Markdown. It works great but there's always things missing I wish
            I had. Some markdown libraries support tables while some don't, or defer to extensions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've come across Asciidoc recently and it seems to be exactly what I'd like. Even as a general document
            format, it seems pretty handy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hugo does have support for it, but it runs with some hardcoded flags that are annoying. It requires a Hugo
            heading block so you might get a mix like so:

            This works fine but I'd like to stick to just one single format. Mixing metadata just for Hugo and metadata
            just for Asciidoc is annoying so I'll have a look into that. Asciidoc itself provides pretty much everything
            I'd want out the box for a static site. The remainder is just building the category pages and so on, which I
            don't necessarily need a fully fledged framework for.

          </h2>
          <p>I've got a list of topics I sometimes keep handy but I haven't invested much time into exploring.</p>
          <p>
            Off the top of my head, there's some stuff I'd like to write about and others I'd have to research. In no
            particular order:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>A writeup of all the iterations of my site with pros and cons (eg; Django, Flask, Hugo, Jekyll etc)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>A comparison of "Prepay SMS UIs"</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    A little while ago I changed cell providers (and then switched back). Topping up credit using SMS
                    based menus was fascinating since it's like this whole web.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    It'd be interesting to model the various states you can get into and just talk about text based UIs
                    in general
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps there'd be some lessons from there that could be reused in chat based UIs or whatever the
                    flavour of the month is with Slack.

                    I'm not hardline "my freedoms" so I still run eg; Instagram and what not. The idea isn't to be pure

                    I recently imported some stuff to Gitlab. I haven't invested much time into it but it seems

                    Us humans seem to be bad at picking mediums. We do tweetstorms about political policy or complex
                    issues rather than doing long form.

                    To fit eg; Twitter's message size, you're going to simplify ideas as much as you can (but no more)
                    but nuance may get lost in the process.

                    Maybe a mix of the two is would suit me best. Just use asciidoc (via a subprocess) to render pages /
                    store them statically while dynamically building the list type pages

            I just gotta start leaving my laptop at work or else I get tempted to work on work technologies honestly.
            None of the above is hard but it's easy to get side tracked or want to finish off something.

            In this case, there's no requirement for me to do so. Things just happen to cross over with my interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, this post is me committing to changing that, and also having a list of things to look into before I
            forget.

          <p>Perhaps we'll do a 26 this time next year. On that note.</p>

                This site is essentially my portfolio but I don't care to make it particularly professional. The style
                is "Things past me would enjoy stumbling upon".

                While there may be some posts about specialised topics, none of them should be sacred and should attempt
                to be readable by anyone.

                  There's that scale that tells you if text is at a 3rd grade reading level etc. That could be an
                  interesting thing to run over some posts.

                I rarely look at analytics. They don't have any bearing on what I write. Comments I don't mind but
                they're not really integrated well. Maybe I'll get rid of them.

                I'd like the site to be a bit more nice to look at. I tried the whole dark scheme for a bit and it's
                good but not quite perfect. Maybe I even support both?

              <p>Reference books seem to have some cool layouts. I could probably pull some inspiration from them.</p>

                I think I've fallen out of love with menus. If I do have then, breadcrumb style things might be a way to
                go.

                I'd like to look back in a few years and see a bunch of stuff that reflects who I was, and how much I
                know, at that point in time. That's partly why having a format that lasts is important since Hugo may
                disappear one day for all I know.
