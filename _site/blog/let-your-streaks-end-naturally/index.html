          <p>Generally speaking, it's always a good idea to let your streaks end when the time is right.</p>
          <p>
            For instance, I took up journalling just before the start of October of 2020 and had an unbroken streak
            until the middle of December 2020. I picked it up again in the middle of January and it ran all the way
            until the start of June when I had a particularly troubling <a href="/blog/ride-the-curve/">life event</a>.
          </p>
          <p>Now having said that, this is where I admit that my journalling streak was kept alive artificially.</p>
          <p>
            I didn't actually fill out each entry on each given day but instead, I would forget about it and backfill
            days (or even a week!) at a time. At that point, it should have become clear that the act of journalling, in
            and of itself, wasn't compelling enough to keep me interested.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I sit back and think about it, it's probably fair to say that I was more invested in the aesthetics of
            keeping a journal more than the journal itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> has a cool feature for
            <a href="https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/769055-book-printing">printing books</a> and the idea of
            having a coffee table book<sup
              ><a
                href="#user-content-fn-coffeetable"
                id="user-content-fnref-coffeetable"
                data-footnote-ref
                aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                >1</a
              ></sup
            >
            was very cool but these are all side effects of journaling.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm sure it's ok to pursue a habit as a means to the actual thing you want to achieve but just as long as
            you're aware of the potential pitfalls.
          </p>
          <p>
            On any given week where I failed to complete an entry, the days between the streak and the present built
            into little mounds of guilt. Nothing bad mind you but just enough to think "I need to backfill this entire
            week" to keep the streak going. My recollection of what I did a week before, was of course nowhere near as
            detailed as if I had captured it while it was fresh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly, while the streak icon was burning brightly, I was well aware in my mind that the flame had
            gone out long ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I resolved to only fill in a journal entry if I naturally felt compelled to, it was actually quite
            freeing. I didn't have to think about the artificial guilt that comes with completionism<sup
              ><a
                href="#user-content-fn-completionism"
                id="user-content-fnref-completionism"
                data-footnote-ref
                aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                >2</a
              ></sup
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Funnily enough, some things I haven't decided to explicitly grow a streak in, such as reviewing
            <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a> bookmarks, have since developed into their own streaks naturally.
          </p>
          <p>I'm sure these too will end too when the time is right and that's completely fine.</p>
          <p>Perhaps you could say the same of relationships too.</p>

                  A riduculous idea of course, since I'm missing journal entries ranging from my birth to my 25th
                  birthday. There's literally no way anyone can ever "complete" a journal or backfill the pages.
