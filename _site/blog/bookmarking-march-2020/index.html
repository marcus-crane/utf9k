          <p>
            For no particular reason, other than I figured it might help me make better sense of how I organise
            articles, here's a fairly detailed breakdown of my bookmarking setup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I'm using <a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop.io</a> but I've also used
            <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and
            <a href="https://larder.io">Larder</a> happily in the past too.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the moment, Raindrop seems like the most comprehensive of the bookmarking apps I've tried. It has a very
            nice UI, a consistent desktop/mobile experience, a (newly launched) API and supports syncing content to a
            storage provider (Dropbox or Google Drive) too.
          </p>
          <p>Anyway, I've linked some articles that I've found interesting myself within a lot of the categories.</p>
          <p>
            Most of them need some work, and I've got almost as many unsorted bookmarks as I do sorted since I write a
            custom title, description and apply tags for searching rather than just dumping them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had a lot of stuff from Pocket that I archived which makes up the bulk of it. Most things I had in
            Pinboard were tagged so they were easy to transition into Raindrop.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you've got any feedback or want to share your own bookmarking categories, let me know! You can find my
            contact details on my <a href="/about">about</a> page B)

            Some recommendations from other developers (eg; keep a logbook), utilities (resume creators, competency
            matrixes) and other tools for improving as a developer

          </h3>
          <p>
            Links to "historical events" which can be anything from
            <a href="https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/20791">unexpected outages</a> and
            <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191">long running debates</a> to
            <a href="http://www.doublewide.net/passport.htm">fascinating snippets that somehow haven't been lost yet</a>

          <h3 id="languages"><a aria-hidden="true" class="jumplink" tabindex="-1" href="#languages">¶ </a>Languages</h3>
          <p>
            Anything specific to a programming language whether it be a blog post, tutorial, library or book. At the
            moment, I haven't split these out into subcategories as each article is tagged with their respective
            langauges anyway making search easy.

            <a aria-hidden="true" class="jumplink" tabindex="-1" href="#lower-level">¶ </a>Lower Level
          </h3>
          <p>
            Anything related to "low level things". As someone who deals primarily with higher level languages (Python,
            Javascript) day to day, I classify C++ and C as low level too, haha.

          </h3>
          <p>
            This is really just blog posts with no particular category or links to entire websites or blogs. Neighbours
            in this term just means other developers in the industry.

          <p>As it suggests on the tin, any articles, posts etc related to networking in general.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>
            This is a pretty new and empty category. I'm misusing the term on purpose as it has links to articles
            relating to observability as well as monitoring.
          </p>
          <h3 id="reference-materials">
            <a aria-hidden="true" class="jumplink" tabindex="-1" href="#reference-materials">¶ </a>Reference Materials
          </h3>
          <p>
            Anything (lists, lists of lists, books, websites etc) that are useful to reference. There are some things in
            here that shouldn't be such as books on building applications in a specific language so it's a little bit of
            a dumping ground at the moment. I don't have a good distinction for where language-specific guides should
            live (languages or reference materials?)

            As it says on the tin. Recommendations as well as

          <p>
            If it's technical / software development related but not part of any specific category (Unicode for
            example), I stick it in here

          <p>
            This is another wishy-washy category since it has some things which should be
            <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/">part of Growing As A Developer</a> as well as
            things that are more like
            <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/xml">how you should properly structure data</a> rather than the actual
            act of development itself. I still need to refine this more.
