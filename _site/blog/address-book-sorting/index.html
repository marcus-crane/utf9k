          <p>
            When I boot up an Apple device for the first time, it always strikes me as annoying to find that the address
            book is sorted by last name first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking about this further, I think the frustration stems from my being more unfamiliar with last names
            than first. It's not like I don't know their last names either.
          </p>
          <p>
            It could be a lookup issue in the sense that I have to visualise the full name of a person and then break
            off the end chunk and put it first. That is, in a sense that's what my brain is doing rather than jumping
            straight to their first name.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do wonder if last names are less commonly used? For example, I can't remember the last time I ever
            referred to someone by their last name ie Ms. Blah.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would partly chalk that up to a mix of my age, tendency to hate overly formal things and my general
            professional which is... not traditionally professional shall we say.
          </p>
          <p>
            For that reason, I tend to think of people by their first names and I always dig out that setting and turn
            it off.
          </p>
          <p>
            It could be that it's more the realm of business people, who have more formal connections (and business
            cards) than I do. For that reason, it might be that they don't tend to use first names as prominently?
          </p>
          <p>
            I could google search it, and I will, but before then it makes me wonder how many other default settings are
            considered weird to other people?
          </p>
          <p>
            Autocorrection is another one where I find that I need to toggle off all the assistance features or I'll be
            driven mad. I prefer my screen real estate!
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps there's a committee of address book creators too, who uphold the guidelines of what makes a good
            address book. I'm just speculating at this point.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd be interested to know what other default settings bug you! You can let me know through the variety of
            different mediums in the footer below.
