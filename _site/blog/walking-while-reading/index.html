          <p>
            There is a person who lives in my general area that I've spotted two or three times in the almost three
            years that I have lived at my flat.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has a book open and reads it, while walking and for the most part, seemingly not paying any attention to
            where he is going.
          </p>
          <p>It feels entirely ridiculous and comical so it's definitely noticeable whenever I do spot him.</p>
          <p>
            That behaviour is something I think I've seen before at school where you would have that one kid seemingly
            glued to a book.
          </p>
          <p>
            How that knowledge is used is beyond me since they never seem to do much else besides reading but that's
            besides the point.
          </p>
          <p>As ridiculous as their actions seem, we're effectively all that person now.</p>
          <p>
            Anytime we get the urge to see what new chat message has arrived or whip out a device to flick through a
            music playlist.
          </p>
          <p>It's really just the same behaviour but without the persistence.</p>
          <p>
            I probably never learned anything from quickly skimming my "Liked Songs" on Spotify while waiting for a
            traffic light though.
