            Yesterday, I had an onset of severe abdominal pains. I didn't want to overreact so I called
            <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/services-and-support/health-care-services/healthline"
              >Healthline</a
            >
            who recommended I see either my GP, or
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department">A&#x26;E</a> within the next 6 hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shortly after I hung up, I had a pain spike bad enough to make me burst into tears. I wasn't getting
            anywhere clutching my stomach on the floor so I called an ambulance.
          </p>
          <p>
            An operator took my information, said that someone would be on their way and then hung up. I waited… and
            waited… Just over an hour passed before I gave up and called an Uber. One just happened to be 2 minutes
            away, with the entire trip only taking about 10 minutes from start to finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of me worried they had turned up only to find me not there so I called back and asked to have the
            request cancelled. They did so and I asked what the state of the callout was only to find that nothing was
            ever dispatched due to a high callout rate in my area. Presumably based on my age and the symptoms, they
            figured I was at low risk?
          </p>
          <p>
            It didn't leave me with a good feeling or sense of security but it did get me wondering about two things:
            Statistics and the future of emergency services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of this article would likely have been joking about how there will probably be "Uber for Ambulances" as
            I often have.

            writeups about how patients are using ridesharing services in place of ambulances and I think I understand
            why.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www2.ku.edu/~kuwpaper/2017Papers/201708.pdf">This non-peer reviewed paper</a> in particular,
            from the University of Kansas, noted an 8% decline in ambulance callouts following the launch of Uber in
            each respective city measured in the study.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now having said all this, there was actually an announcement this time last year for
            <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-health/">Uber Health</a> in the US. The service is more for
            booking health-related rides on behalf of patients, as opposed to straight up replacing ambulances but give
            it enough time and I could see that extra capacity being leveraged to fill in the gaps.
          </p>
          <p>
            My second question, and one that I'm not really qualified to answer, is to do with the actual callout rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_New_Zealand">St John</a> Organisation are the primary
            dispatcher of ambulances in New Zealand, providing emergency services to
            <a href="https://www.stjohn.org.nz/What-we-do/St-John-Ambulance-Services/">nearly 90% of New Zealanders</a>
            according to their own website.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have a handy
            <a href="https://www.stjohn.org.nz/News--Info/Our-Performance/Response-Times/">section on response times</a>
            which links to the
            <a
              href="https://www.health.govt.nz/new-zealand-health-system/key-health-sector-organisations-and-people/naso-national-ambulance-sector-office/emergency-ambulance-services-eas/performance-quality-and-safety/emergency-ambulance-service-national-performance-reports"
              >Ministry of Health's Emergency Ambulance Service national performance reports</a
            >. Look a bit closer and you'll see "For information about St John’s performance visit the performance
            section of their web site." which just leads us back to where we started!
          </p>
          <p>
            Thankfully, their annual reports contain some of the information we're after. Let's take the
            <a
              href="https://www.stjohn.org.nz/globalassets/documents/publications/annual-report/stj-annual-report_2018_lq.pdf"
              >2018 Annual report</a
            >
            as an example.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we jump all the way to Page 50, we can see a breakdown of numbers with 533,669 ambulance emergency calls
            made. Another line item mentions 480,411 patients treated or transported by ambulance officers. If we were
            to very roughly assume that 1 call correlated with 1 patient, that would leave 53,258 calls that are never
            responded to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obviously that's not the whole picture. One call could be for a car crash with multiple injuries while the
            already deceased may not be counted as "Patients treated or transported". Similarly, it doesn't take into
            account prank calls, duplicate calls and no-show patients who can't cancel callouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Either way, I think it still does point out that there's likely a chunk of callouts that never get responded
            to as a result of unstaffing combined with ever increasing callout numbers. It's pretty dystopian having
            something like the "Gig Economy" acting as a replacement for essential services but I suppose I'll take what
            I can get.
          </p>
          <p>Besides, I never liked the attention that came with flashing lights and sirens anyway.</p>
