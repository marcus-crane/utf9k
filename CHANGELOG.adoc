:toc:

== 2019

=== September

==== 27th

* Removed italics to make the site easier to read, and fixed some typos in the email lookup post

==== 26th

* Wrote a blog post about a handy trick I use to look up email addresses that I'm not 100% sure about link:/blog/email-lookup[»]

==== 7th

* Backfilled the changelog some more. Entries mentioned new posts now link to said posts
* Swapped the (supposedly placeholder) https://graphemica.com/%E2%8F%8E[return symbol (U+23CE)] being used as a back button for a https://graphemica.com/%E2%9E%B2[circled heavy white rightwards arrow (U+27B2)]. I couldn't find a leftwards version so I just rotated it using some CSS
* Updated some links to be relative, such as the CHANGELOG on the front page which was a link to the live version up until now. Much nicer for working locally.

==== 1st

* Realised I had broken all of the links when porting to Jekyll! Links like `/blog/lore-tabs` now looked like `blog/2018-02-28-lore-tabs`. This wouldn't be such a big deal but I've linked to some posts and I know that searching `arch linux on intel nuc` on Google brings up my post in 3rd place. Hopefully it's useful for some people, despite possibly being a little out of date. It's a handy Arch guide in general I think, since I use it myself. I should write more in depth explainers sometime.

=== August

==== 29th

* Switched the primary repo for this site from Github to Gitlab
* Filled out the majority of the changes for 2019.
* Added this changelog to track all the different variations of my site over time (will fill it out later)
* Moved to Jekyll. I wanted to try Asciidoc and Hugo puts some limitations on Asciidoc rendering.
  - I also removed all of the list type pages in favour of having everything the front page. Still not sure how I feel about it so it might change some more in the future!
  - Fixed some small typos on posts while porting them from markdown to asciidoc. Everything starts at v1.0 with those amended updated to v1.1

==== 19th

* Wrote a post about turning 25. It was mainly just a tangent about what I'd like to do with this site going forward. link:/blog/25[»]

==== 6th

* Added an MIT License. All of my stuff already carries an MIT license anyway.

=== July

==== 29th

* Wrote a post about extracting credentials from Jenkins link:/blog/retrieving-jenkins-credentials[»]
* Removed pagination from the blog list page

==== 20th

* Added https://forestry.io[foresty.io] configuration again. It wouldn't survive very long.
* Added a post about fixing an issue with upgrading from WSL v1 to v2. I remember drinking a bit when I finally solved this probably so I drunkly wrote this post too :) link:/blog/wsl2-vhd-issue[»]

=== May

==== 21st

* Revamped everything to follow a dark theme while still aiming to be readable. It was inspired by a website I was browsing on an iPhone 6S Plus set to greyscale mode!
* All of the CSS was entirely from scratch whereas I had been using CSS frameworks up until now.

=== March

==== 21st

* Added a post thinking about the future of emergency services. This would have been shortly after I had been admitted to hospital, if not the same day. link:/blog/future-of-emergency-services[»]

==== 18th

* Uploaded my resume as a static asset for easy linking. Not particular relevant to the content of the site.

=== February

==== 22nd

* Uploaded some images from a work related incident. Looking back, I probably shouldn't have but there's nothing particular useful or secret in there anyway.

==== 10th

* Uploaded `vsreport.html` which was a security review of sorts for a videogame I was playing. I had churned it out like an entire year prior but never hosted it anywhere. I think I was talking to someone about it and wanted to send them a link.

==== 7th

* Tried out https://forestry.io[forestry.io] for the first time and quickly discarded it. It's a cool project but I don't have much use for it myself.

==== 3rd

* Wrote my first review in like 2 years. It wasn't a review at all, it was more just me gushing about Battle Angel Alita before the film adaption released. I never did go back and write an actual review... link:/reviews/battle-angel-alita[»]
* Added support for https://utteranc.es/[utteranc.es], a neat little comment section powered by Github.
* Revamed the site to move from tailwind.css to spectre.css
* Some of the layout changed as a result such as adding opengraph metatags and generally going for a more minimalist approach.

=== January

==== 27th

* Removed the stats page from navigation. It was only showing a placeholder page anyway and so far marks the last time it appeared.

==== 15th

* Uploaded my parnell mapping side project (but not presented anywhere user facing)

==== 13th

* Updated currently listening script to point to a proper domain name instead of a raw IP address
* Added some whitespace to the currently listening portion of the footer

== 2018

=== December

==== 29th

* Added a script for showing what I'm currently listening to or watching. It was powered by a single node kubernetes cluster. Hugely overkill but it was an interesting learning experience!

==== 27th

* Removed the project page for ipecac which I didn't really intend to publish yet. It was literally half finished with some sentences that just cut off midway. Oops!
