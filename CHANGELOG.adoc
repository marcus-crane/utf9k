= Changelog
:toc:

== 2019

=== August

==== 29th

* Added this changelog to track all the different variations of my site over time (will fill it out later)
* Moved to Jekyll. I wanted to try Asciidoc and Hugo puts some limitations on Asciidoc rendering.
  - I also removed all of the list type pages in favour of having everything the front page. Still not sure how I feel about it so it might change some more in the future!
  - Fixed some small typos on posts while porting them from markdown to asciidoc. Everything starts at v1.0 with those amended updated to v1.1

==== 19th

* Wrote a post about turning 25. It was mainly just a tangent about what I'd like to do with this site going forward.
