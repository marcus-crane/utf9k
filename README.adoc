The content files that make up my personal site: https://utf9k.net

== Prerequisites

The only thing you'll need to install is https://jekyllrb.com[jekyll], the static site generator that I use to build my site.

https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/[This guide] should step you through everything you need to get setup.

I used to use https://gohugo.io/[hugo] until recently but I've found its support of https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoc] kinda lacking :(

== Deployment

I use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] which automatically builds and deploys any changes pushed to the master branch of Github.

It also allows split deployments, so if a pull request is created, it'll deploy a version separate from my main deployment. It makes previewing the changes easier and also helps avoid pushing a breaking deployment.
