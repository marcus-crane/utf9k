For the unaware, this is inspired by the [/uses](https://uses.tech) page idea

## Text Editor

I flip flop a lot in this area.

For quick edits, including this page, I pop out [nvim](https://neovim.io) although I'm not proficient enough to know many of the keyboard shortcuts.

For Python and Golang projects, [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) has been really interesting and is convincing me to take up neovim as my full time editor.

For larger projects, I tend to reach for [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) although I haven't gotten around to setting up any shared configuration across my devices.

## Terminal

Currently, I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) with [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) Italic 12 and the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/iterm/) colour scheme.

Everything else is stock and unconfigured.

## Computers

* Macbook Pro 15-inch 2020 as my work... workstation
* mac Mini 2018 as my home workstation
* Macbook Air M1 as my remote workstation

Everything except my work laptop is currently running the 2021 Beta (iOS 15, macOS Monterey etc) because I thought notification grouping and built in focus seemed like killer features I didn't want to wait for!
