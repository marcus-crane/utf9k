Here's what I'm up to currently:

## Holiday Season

It's that time of year again.

For myself, I usually visit my parents for a few days and tend to get started on doing a digital spring cleaning.

Going through my task manager, junking all the stuff I don't really want to do as well as cancelling various subscriptions that I don't really need.

There are a couple of things that I currently pay for that I can consolidate by writing a couple of scripts since the problem areas don't change much as well.

## Obsidian Bankruptcy

Not a total bankruptcy but I think I'm at the point where I'd like to archive most of my existing notes to the side and then refresh my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault so that it doesn't have so much junk.

I've ended up with nested folders where I have no real idea what's contained inside them and they're really archival notes that I never refer back to really.

## Hardcover

For some time now, I've been maintaining my list of books read [on my site](https://utf9k.net/books) which works but sometimes it can be annoying sourcing all of the various metadata.

A lot of it isn't automated on my end.

Recently, I learned about [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app) which aspires to be a Goodreads successor.

Most importantly, it has an API so it'd be feasible to start using that and then just pull my data locally similar to what I currently do with [Backloggd](https://backloggd.com).

## Website Refresh

It has been a while since I've given my site a nice tidy up and I'm about ready to sit down and give it all a revamp.

I've been saving various screenshots of design elements around the web that I like so it'll take me a while to figure out what aesthetic elements I'd like to use for this latest iteration.
