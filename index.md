My name is [Marcus Crane](/about/) and you're currently logged on to my personal website.

I maintain a [blog](/blog/) and also keep a running list of [questions](/questions/) regarding topics I often want to remember things about for later.

There's also a [now](/now/) page for, realistically, what I was up to two weeks ago and a [projects](/projects/) page documenting my small experiments.

Finally, if you have any questions or just want to drop a comment, you can pick your poison down in the bottom right of the footer.
