There's no requirement on the internet to say thanks but I'd have absolutely no inspiration (or site) without the following.

In no particular order, shout outs to:

* [Commonmark](https://commonmark.org) for being a solid format that I don't have to think about at all.

* [Cloudflare Design](https://cloudflare.design/color) for making it easy to visualise contrasting colours, and seeing how accessible they are.

* [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com) for being one of the few providers that seemingly allows hassle-free, unlimited aliasing.

* [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) for being a visually nice RSS reader but also for some design elements I "borrowed". Namely the background color of the Sunset theme and the top favicon bar that appears when reading an article.

* [Fly.io](https://fly.io) for making it easy to deploy [Gunslinger](https://github.com/marcus-crane/gunslinger) which powers some of the live aspects of this site. They're also just generally a cool bunch of people who write really insightful [blog posts](https://fly.io/blog/).

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is the static site generator I use so without that, there wouldn't be any site! Well, that's not true, I'd just be using a different one but Hugo seems to be the "best" at present.

* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is the only thing saving me from homelessness. I'd be hosed without this internet bible.

* [owlspace](https://archive.is/kD83O) inspired me to get back into my redesign again. It has a nice homey, handcrafted feeling to it and makes me want to improve my own site much more.
