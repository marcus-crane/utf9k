</head><body><p>To quote everyone's favourite <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2012/10/03/inside-andreessen-horowitz-15-million-investment-in-rap-genius/?sh=7c7d895f4da2">rap enthusiast</a> <a href="https://a16z.com/author/marc-andreessen/">Marc Andreessen</a>, "Software is eating the world" but I'd like to coin my own term in that vein: "Bootstrap is eating the world".</p>
<p>Well, perhaps it already has but it's interesting seeing it pop up in real life from time to time.</p>
<p>In the past few days, I remember seeing it styling the backend calendar system for the gym that I go to and also powering the patient search when I went to get a blood test.</p>
<p>These are only two anecdotal instances of course but I wonder just how many systems are floating around the place that are plowing through work with that instantly recognisable basic Bootstrap template.</p>
<p>My assumption is that it has continued to succeed because it still primarily caters to getting started as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>If you go to the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">homepage</a>, the two links for CSS and JS are right there for use straight out of the box. Similarly, they still distribute single static files too.</p>
<p>It feels like most CSS frameworks are only accessible via <a href="https://npmjs.com">npm</a> with CDN-hosted stylesheets going the way of the dodo so it makes sense that people who choose bootstrap would stick with it. Lack of complexity is effectively a feature after all!</p>
<p>Just imagine how much more productive the planet would be if we just doubled down on Bootstrap and threw away all of the other frontend tooling.</p>
