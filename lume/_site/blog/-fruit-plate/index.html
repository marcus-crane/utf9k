</head><body><p>I ordered a fruit plate about 15 minutes ago.</p>
<p>$20 for a fruit plate and a chai latte is pretty egregious but I think I got a blog post out of it so perhaps it's worth it.</p>
<p>Also, plate is a misnomer because it came in a box but that's besides the point.</p>
<p>I had purchased an Apple Watch not so long ago based on the promise that "Hey, maybe I'll leave my phone at home and be less logged on".</p>
<p>Until just the other day, Spotify streaming via cellular wasn't possible but it seems they expanded the reach of the Beta group and so now it is.</p>
<p>Given that was the last, and arguably most important feature I would want to truly ditch my phone, the "dream" is now a reality.</p>
<p>Of course, whether the dream has been realised is a different story, and I wouldn't go so far as it call it a "false" promise because it's really up to the user to follow through on it.</p>
<p>Anyway, none of that is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>I was sitting on what is effectively a picnic table, in so much as it was on concrete and I have no friends, and I got thinking about the promise of Getting Things Doneâ„¢</p>
<p>While I generally feel like shit, I got to diagnosing it a bit more given I didn't have a phone out to distract me. The link here is that I now just walk to the gym in the morning without it since I can stream Spotify. Thanks Sweden.</p>
<p>Anyway, I realised I haven't done a weekly review in about 2 weeks. I took a break... and then I guess a second break. I've done plenty of weekly reviews so it's not like they're hard and often can be pretty handy.</p>
<p>The greater problem is that I seem to think I should be doing GTD. Well, actually the problem is really just one of productivity in general.</p>
<p>I'm often always productive at work, as is most everyone of course. Productive outside of work? Hmm, maybe not so much. Should I be? Well, no. It's a cliche at this point to bring up the whole "Person thinks they have to be productive because hustle culture is a thing".</p>
<p>I actually read a Gary Vaynerchuk book once when I was a teenager. I think he said caring about your customer is good or something.</p>
<p>Partly, I'm not sure that relaxing is something I know how to do. I've often joked about it but it's kind of true. If I'm reading a book, it's usually for the naive hope that I'll take a bunch of notes and recycle it into something for my website. I'll often watch movies and tv shows, sure. I can't claim that going through a backlog is an extension of relaxing so much as it is completing a checklist though.</p>
<p>Perhaps to some extent, it's just learning how to drop things. Not doing something I don't really care about, and then remembering I didn't do that thing, is still another block in the pile.</p>
<p>I guess this is part of where GTD or any other "productivity" system falls down is that perhaps it assumes you're a reasonable person who gets up at a reasonable time.</p>
<p>I like to think such a thing wouldn't exist if David Allen used Twitter or got distracted 9 times a day by an ocean of Slack notifications.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should eat my fruit box so I can have energy to go and contribute to the economy or whatever</p>
