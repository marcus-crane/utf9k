</head><body><p>There is a person who lives in my general area that I've spotted two or three times in the almost three years that I have lived at my flat.</p>
<p>He has a book open and reads it, while walking and for the most part, seemingly not paying any attention to where he is going.</p>
<p>It feels entirely ridiculous and comical so it's definitely noticeable whenever I do spot him.</p>
<p>That behaviour is something I think I've seen before at school where you would have that one kid seemingly glued to a book.</p>
<p>How that knowledge is used is beyond me since they never seem to do much else besides reading but that's besides the point.</p>
<p>As ridiculous as their actions seem, we're effectively all that person now.</p>
<p>Anytime we get the urge to see what new chat message has arrived or whip out a device to flick through a music playlist.</p>
<p>It's really just the same behaviour but without the persistence.</p>
<p>I probably never learned anything from quickly skimming my "Liked Songs" on Spotify while waiting for a traffic light though.</p>
