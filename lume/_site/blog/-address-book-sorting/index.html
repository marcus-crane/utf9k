</head><body><p>When I boot up an Apple device for the first time, it always strikes me as annoying to find that the address book is sorted by last name first.</p>
<p>Thinking about this further, I think the frustration stems from my being more unfamiliar with last names than first. It's not like I don't know their last names either.</p>
<p>It could be a lookup issue in the sense that I have to visualise the full name of a person and then break off the end chunk and put it first. That is, in a sense that's what my brain is doing rather than jumping straight to their first name.</p>
<p>I do wonder if last names are less commonly used? For example, I can't remember the last time I ever referred to someone by their last name ie Ms. Blah.</p>
<p>I would partly chalk that up to a mix of my age, tendency to hate overly formal things and my general professional which is... not traditionally professional shall we say.</p>
<p>For that reason, I tend to think of people by their first names and I always dig out that setting and turn it off.</p>
<p>It could be that it's more the realm of business people, who have more formal connections (and business cards) than I do. For that reason, it might be that they don't tend to use first names as prominently?</p>
<p>I could google search it, and I will, but before then it makes me wonder how many other default settings are considered weird to other people?</p>
<p>Autocorrection is another one where I find that I need to toggle off all the assistance features or I'll be driven mad. I prefer my screen real estate!</p>
<p>Perhaps there's a committee of address book creators too, who uphold the guidelines of what makes a good address book. I'm just speculating at this point.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to know what other default settings bug you! You can let me know through the variety of different mediums in the footer below.</p>
