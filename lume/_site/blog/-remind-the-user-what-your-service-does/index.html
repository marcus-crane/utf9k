</head><body><p>This goes out to anyone who does marketing for startups and businesses.</p>
<p>If you're about to announce something like an update for those on a waitlist or a big bang version 2, please include a reminder of what your service actually is?</p>
<p>I can't count the number of times I receive an email out of the blue saying "Smergen is nearly here!" only for me to scratch my head out of confusion.</p>
<p>A decent improvement is to just include screenshots (but not those vague "big tech art" things, real ones!)</p>
<p>The actual fix is just to include a one liner like "Smergen - the app that lets you map public toilets".</p>
<p>To really drive it home, here's a masterclass in retaining the user from <a href="https://nvultra.com">nvUltra</a></p>
<p><img src="nvultra.png" alt="An email snippet from nvUltra explaning how they have been infrequent with updates and then providing a detailed reminder on what nvUltra actually is, in simple english."></p>
<p>If you can't take a few seconds to provide some context for what your announcement is about, I can't get excited or even bring myself to care.</p>
