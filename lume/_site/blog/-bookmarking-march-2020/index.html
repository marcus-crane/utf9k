</head><body><p>For no particular reason, other than I figured it might help me make better sense of how I organise articles, here's a fairly detailed breakdown of my bookmarking setup.</p>
<p>Currently I'm using <a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop.io</a> but I've also used <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and <a href="https://larder.io">Larder</a> happily in the past too.</p>
<p>At the moment, Raindrop seems like the most comprehensive of the bookmarking apps I've tried. It has a very nice UI, a consistent desktop/mobile experience, a (newly launched) API and supports syncing content to a storage provider (Dropbox or Google Drive) too.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've linked some articles that I've found interesting myself within a lot of the categories.</p>
<p>Most of them need some work, and I've got almost as many unsorted bookmarks as I do sorted since I write a custom title, description and apply tags for searching rather than just dumping them.</p>
<p>I had a lot of stuff from Pocket that I archived which makes up the bulk of it. Most things I had in Pinboard were tagged so they were easy to transition into Raindrop.</p>
<p>If you've got any feedback or want to share your own bookmarking categories, let me know! You can find my contact details on my <a href="/about">about</a> page B)</p>
<h2>???</h2>
<p>Anything that is generally quirky or surprising like <a href="https://audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/jerry-seinfelds-speakers.48414/">this</a>, <a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/105602/steak-dropped-in-soapy-dish-water">this</a> or <a href="https://oukosher.org/blog/industrial-kosher/peanut-butter-ii-standard-of-identity/">this</a></p>
<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>Great stories or posts that reveal what goes on behind the scenes of various products and companies</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20908168">Generally trends towards game development</a></p>
<h2>Business</h2>
<h3>Economics</h3>
<p>This tends to be anything related to the economy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Babysitting_Co-op">the theory of economics</a> or <a href="https://abstrusegoose.com/389">generally anything to do with money</a></p>
<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>Lessons and resources related to marketing of products, or marketing as an art</p>
<h3>Reports</h3>
<p>Various reports (shareholder, <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/consultation-paper/2019/building-operational-resilience-impact-tolerances-for-important-business-services.pdf">governmental</a>, <a href="https://sriramk.com/memos/goldberg-music.pdf">memos</a>)</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>General advice or reference material for going about conducting business and/or setting one up</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>The art of <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190926">setting strategy</a>, as it relates to business, and <a href="https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/">how business things get done, in spite of their sheer scale</a></p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>Cool websites that have interesting designs in some form or another</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>Design resources such as fonts, CSS frameworks, placeholder images or guides on how best to layout a design</p>
<h3>UI / UX</h3>
<p>Tips and tricks on providing a functional, accessible design. Generally just for web design but doesn't strictly have to be.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p><a href="https://digitalworldproblems.tumblr.com/post/76036641581/while-im-looking-at-that-moviecode-post-he">Anything that doesn't have an obvious category</a>. If there seems to be a grouping of related articles, it'd prompt the creation of a new category but I also don't want to generate more categories that are useful.</p>
<h2>Postmortems</h2>
<p>Reviews in what went wrong, whether it be <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-red-cross-secret-disaster">business</a>, <a href="https://www.defmacro.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html">software</a> or <a href="http://www.fudco.com/chip/lessons.html">videogames</a>. As this category grows, I'll likely split them out into eg; Business/Postmortems but for now, I don't have a big enough collection.</p>
<h2>Productivity</h2>
<p>Anything related to the art of productivity. It may also just be <a href="https://nesslabs.com/jomo">articles reminding you that sometimes less is more!</a></p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>Things that I have been recommended but haven't looked into yet. If they are part of a medium that I track somewhere else (eg; books into Goodreads, games into How Long To Beat), then I tend to just put them there straight away. <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/dead-franchises-almost-nobody-but-you-seems-to-want-back.1355948/">There may be threads that have a wide range of recommendations</a> eg; book recommendations so I generally scour them when I get time and put the interesting items into eg; Goodreads.</p>
<h2>Shopping</h2>
<p>Things that look cool and I might want to buy one day. I may also just want to keep them for reference to link to people too.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Discourse</h3>
<p>A bit of a wishy washy grouping but anything related to discussion of ideas and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton.27s_fence">what can go wrong as a result</a>. Perhaps communication is a clearer name for this category.</p>
<h3>Governments</h3>
<p>Articles related to governments, whether it be their functions, warfare (from a political point of view, not an on-the-ground point of view) or just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071031080918/http://www.geocities.com/capecanaveral/4411/apollo13.htm">"government related things"</a></p>
<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
<p>This can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_System_No._7">specific infrastructure</a> or articles about infrastructure in general ie cost overruns or how a traffic light system operates</p>
<h3>News Media</h3>
<p>Resources provided by the news media (eg; a database containing financial entities and their appearances in the media) or articles about the media itself. This doesn't contain articles FROM the news media however. It's more of a meta category.</p>
<h3>People</h3>
<p>This could be articles on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Parker_(wine_critic)">specific people</a> (biographies, news pieces) or <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scottlucas/san-francisco-spent-a-decade-being-rich-important-and">"people" in a broader sense</a> such as a story on a town or city.</p>
<h3>Politics</h3>
<p>Politics of any form, whether it be governmental (elections, "red tape") or more local such as office or industry politics</p>
<h3>World Views</h3>
<p>A bit of an abstract category. This contains articles and quotes that upon reading, I thought <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14391552">"Oh! This gave me some insight into how certain groups or individuals come to view the world."</a>. That's neither a good or a bad thing, just interesting. Often it contains things that I've never considered before myself.</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>I had two links related to wrestling I put in here. I don't follow sports much but sometimes there can be interesting crossovers between say sports and business.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>Articles, Stack Overflow snippets and links in general related to "databases". For now, this has no subcategorisation between eg; MySQL v Postgres, SQL vs "NoSQL" and databases themselves vs database concepts.</p>
<h3>Growing As A Developer</h3>
<p>Some recommendations from other developers (eg; keep a logbook), utilities (resume creators, competency matrixes) and other tools for improving as a developer</p>
<h3>Historical Events</h3>
<p>Links to "historical events" which can be anything from <a href="https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/20791">unexpected outages</a> and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191">long running debates</a> to <a href="http://www.doublewide.net/passport.htm">fascinating snippets that somehow haven't been lost yet</a></p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Anything specific to a programming language whether it be a blog post, tutorial, library or book. At the moment, I haven't split these out into subcategories as each article is tagged with their respective langauges anyway making search easy.</p>
<h3>Lower Level</h3>
<p>Anything related to "low level things". As someone who deals primarily with higher level languages (Python, Javascript) day to day, I classify C++ and C as low level too, haha.</p>
<h3>Neighbours</h3>
<p>This is really just blog posts with no particular category or links to entire websites or blogs. Neighbours in this term just means other developers in the industry.</p>
<h3>Networking</h3>
<p>As it suggests on the tin, any articles, posts etc related to networking in general.</p>
<h3>Observability</h3>
<p>This is a pretty new and empty category. I'm misusing the term on purpose as it has links to articles relating to observability as well as monitoring.</p>
<h3>Reference Materials</h3>
<p>Anything (lists, lists of lists, books, websites etc) that are useful to reference. There are some things in here that shouldn't be such as books on building applications in a specific language so it's a little bit of a dumping ground at the moment. I don't have a good distinction for where language-specific guides should live (languages or reference materials?)</p>
<h3>Reverse Engineering</h3>
<p>All things related to the art of reverse engineering such as applications, blog posts and reference guides</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>As it says on the tin. Recommendations as well as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2669690/why-does-google-prepend-while1-to-their-json-responses">interesting implementations</a> related to security.</p>
<h3>Shared Concepts</h3>
<p>If it's technical / software development related but not part of any specific category (Unicode for example), I stick it in here</p>
<h3>The Art of Development</h3>
<p>This is another wishy-washy category since it has some things which should be <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/">part of Growing As A Developer</a> as well as things that are more like <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/xml">how you should properly structure data</a> rather than the actual act of development itself. I still need to refine this more.</p>
<h3>The Industry Itself</h3>
<p>This could be stories about <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/library/CONTROVERSY/LAWSUITS/SEA/katzbio.txt">"people" (in an individual sense)</a>, <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx">"people" (in the group sense)</a>, <a href="https://gigaom.com/2011/02/18/war-is-hell-welcome-to-the-twitter-wars-of-2011/">people opposing other people</a> and also <a href="https://eager.io/blog/the-languages-which-almost-were-css/">choices made by people</a>. Sometimes companies too.</p>
<h3>Tooling</h3>
<p>Tools and utilities that are useful to refer to later. Think CLIs, GUIs, CDNs and any other 3 letter combination you like.</p>
<h2>The Art of Writing</h2>
<p>Something I'm looking to flesh out but any articles or references on how to write better!</p>
