# How can I restrict which traffic is allowed to pass through a Kube ingress?
01 January 0001

This one had my scratching my head a bit as I wasn’t quite sure if Kubernetes was the right place to do this.

Depending on your use case, it might make sense to terminate traffic before it reaches your cluster but that may have the effect of filtering traffic to other applications if not done properly.

In this instance, the Kubernetes cluster in question makes use of the NGINX Ingress Controller and as such, honours a whole bunch of flags.

Before we get into the details, let’s set up a small example.

We’ll pretend our desktop has an IP address is 192.0.2.3 exactly. We want to allow only a network range of 1 single address so that say; our mobile device with the address 192.0.2.2 can’t connect but our desktop can.

In CIDR notation, this would be represented as 192.0.2.3/32, with the 32 effectively meaning “Just this one address” instead of any other devices on the 192.0.2 range, or broader.

With our address block defined, let’s look at an ingress:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: my-cool-ingress annotations: nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/whitelist-source-range: &#34;192.0.2.3/24&#34; spec: rules: - host: example.com http: paths: - path: / backend: service: name: example-docs port: name: http-example-docs Ok, we’ve allowed our desktop to connect but let’s try connecting to this ingress from a device we know isn’t allowed, such as our laptop on 192.0.2.6:

&gt; curl https://example.com/ &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;hr&gt;&lt;center&gt;nginx&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Alright, and now from our desktop at 192.0.2.3/24, which we allowed explicitly:

&gt; curl example.com &lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Example Domain&lt;/title&gt; [...] Success! We’ve managed to use nothing but an ingress to block specific traffic but you might wonder, why would I ever use this?

One use case may be exposing applications that require the use of a public endpoint, such as Microsoft Teams or Slack.

Often, you can’t make use of OAuth but you want to protect against random internet traffic so you can explicitly allow known IP ranges.

With Azure for example, they publish a full list of their active IP ranges so if you can’t simply make use of a VNet, this may be the next best thing.
