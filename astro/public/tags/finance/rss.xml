      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week has definitely been one of the more interesting ones I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze&#34;&gt;GameStop short squeeze of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. A pretty fascinating event, that seemed to highlight far more structural issues than the original squeezer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/articles/keith-gill-drove-the-gamestop-reddit-mania-he-talked-to-the-journal-11611931696&#34;&gt;/u/deepfuckingvalue&lt;/a&gt; could have ever predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues to arrive from this event, and one to keep in mind, is the belief that &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinhood.com/us/en/&#34;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; blocked users from buying stock. While I&amp;rsquo;m no day trader, it may turn out that what initially looks like a villanous attempt to screw the little guy is &lt;a href=&#34;https://pca.st/gw6fvzay&#34;&gt;actually the result&lt;/a&gt; of Robinhood being asked to put up even more money to protect against the risk involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter because they effectively look the same. Whether an attempt to screw the little guy or a genuine, albeit irresponsible situation they&amp;rsquo;ve found themselves in, because they can&amp;rsquo;t communicate via any other language than corporate press release jargon, users struggle to tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t really a post about finance though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second event that just so happened to occur this week and is not of any particular note other than I read about it on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; a little bit, is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355663753380032512&#34;&gt;suspension of Element&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store&#34;&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the unaware, Element is essentially a chat client. The servers it connects to are hosted by users rather than all living under one company such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://messenger.com&#34;&gt;Facebook Messenger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.whatsapp.com/&#34;&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;. Ah wait, those are the same company&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also an instance where, due to Google being uncommunicative, users can&amp;rsquo;t discern between malicious intent and &amp;ldquo;the algorithms&amp;rdquo; accidentally making a user report as being reason to take down a chat client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I understand corporate policy means that Google can&amp;rsquo;t openly state why or what triggered problems, it only fuels the sentiment that Google is picking winners and losers at a whim. The lack of transparency provides space to theorise that &amp;ldquo;Ah, Google has a chat client. Many in fact! They must be protecting their own and putting a dampener on competition.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That very well could be true! Personally, I subscribe to the idea that most malicious things are actually just people in close proximity either being inept or actually being malicious for their own reasons, and that proximity creates the illusion of a wide group &amp;ldquo;pulling the strings&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never really thought about why I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at that conclusion before now but I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a mix of &amp;ldquo;It sounds like a good middle of the road option&amp;rdquo; (which can be a bias in itself as well mind you) mixed with the thought of &amp;ldquo;If everything were controlled, why is there so much disorder. We should be much deeper into dystopic territory by now, none of this slow burn crap&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, with all these things stewing in my head, something clicked which is what caused me to sit down right now and churn out this post. It reminded me of one of my old work places. Some of the people leads had a program of sorts that was going to work through previous issues and err, I dunno, make it a better place to work? It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an awful place but it had some instances of &amp;ldquo;Why would anyone think this is a good idea?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure if anything came of those attempts. Maybe a lot changed? If it did, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell and that can definitely be the case when things change slowly over time. Either way, one of the things I used to say in my 1:1 review meetings is something like &amp;ldquo;The difference between a whole lot of stuff happening behind the scenes, and nothing, are pretty much the same&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is to say, imagine yourself watching a play. You&amp;rsquo;re sitting in the front row and the curtains are down. You might start daydreaming about all of the scrambling that must be going on backstage. Actors taking their ready positions. Set people hurridly putting the final touches in place. The lighting people making sure they don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally turn the lights up too slowly at the begining, as I once did back in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that very same moment, someone across the aisle from you is probably thinking &amp;ldquo;What are these people doing? Nothing is happening! What a waste of money if they can&amp;rsquo;t even start on time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this can be chalked up to not understanding, in this case, the requirements of putting on a play. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot! I don&amp;rsquo;t even particularly know myself in great depth so someone who runs those sorts of things surely appreciated the nuance needed to get such a thing running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose all this is to say, it feels like an all too common occurence where a little (or a lot) of transparency can help escape these otherwise unenviable situations. Had Robinhood simply outlined that they fucked up and that they didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough capital to allow trading, maybe we&amp;rsquo;d be in a different position. It would still suck for them but they would be branded as stupid for a little while rather than being branded as &amp;ldquo;Illuminati corporate shill who fucked the little guy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That does go against human nature though where the expectation is that it&amp;rsquo;s safer to be obtuse so that your choices (often with limited information on hand) can&amp;rsquo;t be criticised and ideally not even spotted at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned the series before, which just outlines how much I appreciate the idea, so once more I&amp;rsquo;m going to share the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4I5cq2DfrSpehLO_71NCjKSZE0nGXIvf&#34;&gt;Evernote Behind the Scenes&lt;/a&gt; series that they&amp;rsquo;ve still been going on with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a company that has been understood as having &lt;a href=&#34;https://usefyi.com/evernote-history/&#34;&gt;fallen by the wayside&lt;/a&gt;, I think this is one of the more innovative things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen which genuinely makes me want to see them succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, innovative isn&amp;rsquo;t even the right word like it&amp;rsquo;s not a new or particularly amazing idea but it takes a lot of guts to actually do so props to them and honestly I kind of aspire to do something like that one day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Managing subscriptions with an extra debit card</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/subscription-management/</link>
      <description>In which I save myself from financial hell by putting subscriptions on another card where they can&#39;t creep up on me</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2021 23:40:00 +1300</pubDate>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The title says it all really but I&amp;rsquo;ll go into detail a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the handiest tricks I ever discovered earlier last year, was to get a second debit card issued specifically just for subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, I used to just have my primary account tied to my debit card, and a couple of others that weren&amp;rsquo;t accessible through any physical means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few times, I would get a bit too eager to try out subscription services and slowly, my primary account would get eaten. Similarly, surprise yearly renewals would suddenly eat a portion of my bank account to my horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; for this was to transfer all of my money instantly out of my primary account and across to another savings account. I&amp;rsquo;d keep a minimal amount on my card and perform transfers on the fly as I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually caused me a lot of grief once when I was trying to check into a hotel while visiting America. My bank actually had maintenance on their mobile app so I was stuck with just shy of the required bank deposit and no way to access any of my money. Thankfully, the clerk let me pay it in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got particularly bad when I joined a gym. They would do their debit charges on a Friday but I swear it never felt consistent. Sometimes it would be on a Saturday or it would be first thing Friday morning. More than a few times, I forgot or be late, causing both the charge to decline and myself to pay a dishonour fee as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, at this point, you may think that I should have been more vigilant in transfering across the required amount which brings us full circle. Sometimes I would perform a transfer for the required amount the night before&amp;hellip; only for a subscription renewal to eat into the balance, causing a decline because what the heck, suddenly I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it occured to me that when you break it down, there are two streams of charges: those that are controlled (ie I physically swipe my card) and those that I would call erratic. The latter are often a known quantity but soetimes they&amp;rsquo;re a moving target, sometimes my dumb human brain forgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the feeling is that of being inside of an interrogation room. That is to say, there&amp;rsquo;s a kind of one way mirror where I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what could jump out at any minute and eat my wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, what I did was requested a second debit card that I use entirely just for subscriptions and the like. I don&amp;rsquo;t do anything fancy, just roughly eyeball how much is expected to go out based on last month and transfer it in. Every week or so I&amp;rsquo;ll move amounts in and out based on how close to the mark I&amp;rsquo;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very handy side effect is that you&amp;rsquo;ve also got a clear view into your recurring expenses. Often times you can forget you&amp;rsquo;re subscribed to something for a long time because the transactions are buried amongst your life stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your subscription only bank account, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a continuous feed of things you&amp;rsquo;re subscribed to and hey, you didn&amp;rsquo;t even need to pay a SaaS company to figure it out!&lt;/p&gt;
