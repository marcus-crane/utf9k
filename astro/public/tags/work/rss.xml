      <content type="html">&lt;div class=&#34;notice&#34;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;ðŸ§ª&lt;/span&gt;This post is a sort of weird living document of sorts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I got kind of lazy towards the end so I&amp;rsquo;m pushing out what I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I also intend to add to the list of bullet points as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of post that is harder to capture the further away you are from the situation in question!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally on this site I have two types of posts: Relatively straight forward technical posts and long-winded, more experimental posts that I would just link to myself in the past if time travel existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is heavily one of the latter and it revolved around a certain type of unintentional competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s targeted at an awkward gap at which I, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of us, have fallen into from time to time which I&amp;rsquo;ll define in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, these are scenarios I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered in a work setting but I suppose they could apply just as equally in any sort of community from friend groups to event committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep this whole thing general enough so as to leave it open for your own intepretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll probably also make this a &amp;ldquo;living document&amp;rdquo; that I add things to as I think of them. It&amp;rsquo;ll be pretty messy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-twin-scenarios&#34;&gt;The twin scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;a) You have just created and launched something into the wild, only to find that someone else in your area is already invested in that problem domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Someone else has just created and launched something into the wild, which you have just discovered and you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure how to feel about it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two scenarios are the same scenario, just from different angles. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve both caused Scenario A and felt the effects of Scenario B. I&amp;rsquo;ve even experienced both A and B for the same problem domain within the same year, which felt a bit like karma funnily enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scenarios happen all the time for everything I&amp;rsquo;m sure and neither side can feel pleasant. Emotions get heated, people get protective of &amp;ldquo;their&amp;rdquo; domains that they&amp;rsquo;ve invested time into and things can turn a bit sour if they&amp;rsquo;re not evaluated properly with some perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all things emotional, you should step back and think about the bigger picture!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in that narrow period of time, or just want some tips for next time on how you might deal with it then here are some thoughts you might want to mull over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just going to throw out bullet points because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) It&amp;rsquo;s quicker and I&amp;rsquo;m being lazy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) I can&amp;rsquo;t give you the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s never an open and shut case, as much as you might want to cite time investment, experience, job titles and all sorts of other things you can reach for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best answer is the one that sucks and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t arrived at a good time but there&amp;rsquo;s never really a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and one last thing: When you invest time and effort into something, it&amp;rsquo;s natural to feel emotional! You can&amp;rsquo;t unlogic yourself out of those feelings and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not up for the task, don&amp;rsquo;t read these points and beat yourself up by any means. That&amp;rsquo;s not what this is for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just things to ask yourself in a neutral light. Don&amp;rsquo;t judge yourself for actions that have already passed. It&amp;rsquo;s more about deciding what to do next and what you might do differently next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-experiencing-scenario-a&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing Scenario A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve just created something and you&amp;rsquo;ve been informed that your idea already exists in some other form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How was the reaction that you received?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was it welcoming to a newcomer into that space?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no, that&amp;rsquo;s not very nice
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is that? Does this happen a lot?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, that sounds like a them problem right? Something keeps going wrong that people arrive at the conclusion that they need to start from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-experiencing-b&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing B&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve have or are actively creating something and you&amp;rsquo;ve been informed that someone has just stepped into your problem domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are you feeling about this news right now?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you excited for some new competition, regardless of whether you agree with the approach?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, great, that sounds healthy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no, why is that?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you feel that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t compare in terms of quality to your work?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, why does that matter?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does a new offering existing somehow take away from your work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your work able to stand on its own merits?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no, should it exist if it can&amp;rsquo;t support itself and needs ie; political cover to stay alive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you feel that people don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate it fully?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have solid documentation and announcements that people can discover on their own time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your approach communicated clearly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the problem space too deep in the weeds for people who are not domain experts to &amp;ldquo;get it&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you considered making use of metaphors, or just general storytelling to help bridge the communication gap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has enough time actually passed for people to &amp;ldquo;have time&amp;rdquo; to learn about your offering and to &amp;ldquo;get it&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you actually talked to anyone about your problem area?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you know that this problem area is actually a problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do other people see this problem area as being a problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do other people have this problem enough to &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; that it is a problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the length of the problem only felt in short enough bursts that others are not motivated enough to seek out a solution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you feel an emotion reaction to this news?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, why is that?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you consider yourself to be an expert in this particular domain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you spend a lot of time working in this particular domain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this particular domain just one that you spend time in or your core one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you felt an overwhelming emotion reaction, is your identity and sense of self worth tied into this domain?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should it be? Maybe it is more than you realise?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you feel that you could walk away from this problem domain and not feel a great loss?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you need to diversity your identity a bit more and find some different hobbies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>I didn&#39;t want to be an astronaut as a kid</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/not-being-an-astronaut/</link>
      <description>Some thoughts on what career I thought I might like as a kid</description>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Jan 2022 16:40:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/not-being-an-astronaut/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those who read my blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that one of the long running arcs is documenting my thoughts as I enter each new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/day-xero&#34;&gt;Day Xero&lt;/a&gt; was initially just a standalone post I slapped together as I departed for my first day as a member of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xero.com/nz/about/graduate/&#34;&gt;Xero graduate program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was since joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/day-one&#34;&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mercedes-benz-trucks.com/content/mbo/markets/en_NZ/home.html&#34;&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/day-two&#34;&gt;Day Two&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vendhq.com/nz/&#34;&gt;Vend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and I&amp;rsquo;m sure in time there will inevitably be a few more entries but for now, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy where I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think too much about where I wanted to eventually end up nor did I ever actually expect to end up here in the first place. Back when I worked my shitty retail jobs, I was convinced that I had &amp;ldquo;missed the boat&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so I never had any solid ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the title of this post. I remembered about a year or so back that when I was younger, I had this dumb idea that I wanted to be a &amp;ldquo;skateboarding CEO&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I took it quite literally when I was younger but I think I what I actually found cool was the idea of constrast. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to break some expectations (and rules!) in a respectful way and as a kid, I was probably more interested in the idea of &amp;ldquo;being a unprofessional professional&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, I don&amp;rsquo;t focus so much on the CEO part&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as I do on the contrast bit. For anyone who follows me on social media, you&amp;rsquo;ll have noticed my recent &amp;ldquo;obsession&amp;rdquo; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumamon&#34;&gt;Kumamon&lt;/a&gt;, the loveable Japanese bear who represents the Kumatoto region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I do actually enjoy watching various bits of content by Kumamon after recently rediscovering him. I&amp;rsquo;ve actually found the fact that such ridiculous content can continue to exist, even in the midst of the confusing times we live in. Nothing gets rid of stress like popping open a video of a goofy bear falling over or whatever antics he&amp;rsquo;s up to this week but that&amp;rsquo;s besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other purpose of my silly &amp;ldquo;obsession&amp;rdquo; is that it acts as a type of contrast I alluded to earlier. Growing up, I always believed that to be successful meant being super serious and dedicated to a fault. You always see hackers and so on coding away into the wee hours of the night in movie and such. Well, this is my little contribution towards dispelling the idea&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that being or doing silly things is at odds with being capable. You can be both at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just Kumamon mind you. There are other things like some of my favourite shirts and what not but they all basically represent the same idea in some form or another. I also just find it funny, in an absurd sense, seeing myself in a goofy shirt while I default to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_bitch_face&#34;&gt;RBF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I can&amp;rsquo;t claim that it does or doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any effect, I also like to think that if anyone finds anything I do worth looking up to&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, that it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat comforting to know that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a super 10x hardcore asshole to accomplish things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I still took the &amp;ldquo;skateboarding CEO&amp;rdquo; idea literally, I would be (and was!) quite disappointed because it would be years and years until I accomplish it but by looking at it from a different angle, I realised that I already kinda made it there. At a smaller scale to be sure, but once you come to terms with the idea that bigger isn&amp;rsquo;t always better, it can be pretty comforting to have smaller, more achievable ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s probably enough of that for now. I&amp;rsquo;ve only really mentioned the above to one person I can think of but I figure it&amp;rsquo;d be handy to write it out so &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/zettelkasten-blog-a-good-idea/&#34;&gt;I can refer to it again in future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;ll change over time and I&amp;rsquo;ll believe in the idea of being a 20xer instead but either way, being able to review your trajectory through writing is a pretty neat idea and while I can&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy it so much, I hope someone down the line can enjoy seeing my years of progress condensed into a handful of posts and possibly get some use out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of a misnomer on my part since I never went to university. Instead I went near insane from 3 years of retail before attending &lt;a href=&#34;https://devacademy.co.nz&#34;&gt;Enspiral Dev Academy&lt;/a&gt; as a last ditch effort before giving up. That was complimented by years of being a hobbyist prior and a couple more years of doing side projects and being rejected from jobs before I finally got my entrance into the industry.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically I work for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lightspeedhq.com&#34;&gt;Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt; but I work on Vend. The product is referred to as Vend by Lightspeed but eventually we&amp;rsquo;ll just be part of Lightspeed. I don&amp;rsquo;t know for a fact that has been explicitly mentioned but it&amp;rsquo;s hardly a secret if you look at the trajectory on the public website.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually rejected from a university computer science course for not having enough math credits. Probably because I found Statistics boring and would skip class to go fiddle with HTML in the school library instead. Nowadays I have my rejection letter (aka &amp;ldquo;diploma&amp;rdquo;) framed on my desk at work.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large companies, especially anything VC funded, are overrated. Keeping it manageable with little to no debt is where it&amp;rsquo;s at if you ask me. Being propped up by large amounts of outside funding and becoming &amp;ldquo;planet scale&amp;rdquo; is just asking for a slow death in my book. Even worse is the idea of just bailing out at the IPO stage and leaving all of your employees holding the bag with a company that gets put into maintenance mode.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which I myself held in the past to a solid extent!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten two emails of thanks which is two more than I ever expected to get from this website. I also expect that &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/publish-old-works/&#34;&gt;old posts may get dug up in future&lt;/a&gt; without my knowledge at all which I look forward to. If not, that&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine because with my goldfish memory, I can enjoy my old posts. I once re-read &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/deepfakes&#34;&gt;deepfakes&lt;/a&gt; and thought &amp;ldquo;Damn, I never knew any of this.&amp;rdquo;. Of course, I did know it at some point but entirely forgot it all&amp;hellip;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Conditionally setting your gitconfig</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/conditional-gitconfig/</link>
      <description>Did you know you can change Git attributes based on what folder you&#39;re in?</description>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 20:17:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/conditional-gitconfig/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Personally, I try to keep my development environment as convenient to use as possible and with the advent of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp&#34;&gt;BeyondCorp-style zero trust&lt;/a&gt;, more internal services are thankfully available without a VPN required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes it easy to access tooling from your mobile device and other places but it can also mean the line between work and personal blurs a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my custom work-related configuration has been deprecated (utilities for wrangling VPNs and proxies) and I basically don&amp;rsquo;t maintain anything more than what was &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/dotfiles&#34;&gt;already open sourced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last holdout has been my git configuration however, as I want to create work commits with my work email and vice versa for open source commits. It had been my impression that git had no way to support this but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been true for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_conditional_includes&#34;&gt;conditional includes&lt;/a&gt;, you can dynamically switch instances of your &lt;code&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt; on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at an example. For example purposes, let&amp;rsquo;s say that my code lives in &lt;code&gt;$HOME/work&lt;/code&gt; and my personal code lives in &lt;code&gt;$HOME/projects&lt;/code&gt;. You can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; user@example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; User
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;signingkey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ABC123
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;commit&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;gpgSign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;includeIf &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;gitdir:~/work/&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ~/.work.gitconfig
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;rsquo;re doing here is setting our default variables but upon interacting with a &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; initialised repository within the &lt;code&gt;~/work&lt;/code&gt; folder, we instead use our work-based config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example of this in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;/Users/person
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; git config user.email
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;user@example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/work
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;/Users/person/work
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; git config user.email
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;business@work.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fruit Plate</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/fruit-plate/</link>
      <description>A minor tangent about... I don&#39;t remember, GTD and fruit?</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/fruit-plate/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I ordered a fruit plate about 15 minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$20 for a fruit plate and a chai latte is pretty egregious but I think I got a blog post out of it so perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, plate is a misnomer because it came in a box but that&amp;rsquo;s besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had purchased an Apple Watch not so long ago based on the promise that &amp;ldquo;Hey, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll leave my phone at home and be less logged on&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until just the other day, Spotify streaming via cellular wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible but it seems they expanded the reach of the Beta group and so now it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that was the last, and arguably most important feature I would want to truly ditch my phone, the &amp;ldquo;dream&amp;rdquo; is now a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, whether the dream has been realised is a different story, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go so far as it call it a &amp;ldquo;false&amp;rdquo; promise because it&amp;rsquo;s really up to the user to follow through on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, none of that is neither here nor there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting on what is effectively a picnic table, in so much as it was on concrete and I have no friends, and I got thinking about the promise of Getting Things Doneâ„¢&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I generally feel like shit, I got to diagnosing it a bit more given I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a phone out to distract me. The link here is that I now just walk to the gym in the morning without it since I can stream Spotify. Thanks Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I realised I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a weekly review in about 2 weeks. I took a break&amp;hellip; and then I guess a second break. I&amp;rsquo;ve done plenty of weekly reviews so it&amp;rsquo;s not like they&amp;rsquo;re hard and often can be pretty handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater problem is that I seem to think I should be doing GTD. Well, actually the problem is really just one of productivity in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m often always productive at work, as is most everyone of course. Productive outside of work? Hmm, maybe not so much. Should I be? Well, no. It&amp;rsquo;s a cliche at this point to bring up the whole &amp;ldquo;Person thinks they have to be productive because hustle culture is a thing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually read a Gary Vaynerchuk book once when I was a teenager. I think he said caring about your customer is good or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that relaxing is something I know how to do. I&amp;rsquo;ve often joked about it but it&amp;rsquo;s kind of true. If I&amp;rsquo;m reading a book, it&amp;rsquo;s usually for the naive hope that I&amp;rsquo;ll take a bunch of notes and recycle it into something for my website. I&amp;rsquo;ll often watch movies and tv shows, sure. I can&amp;rsquo;t claim that going through a backlog is an extension of relaxing so much as it is completing a checklist though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps to some extent, it&amp;rsquo;s just learning how to drop things. Not doing something I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about, and then remembering I didn&amp;rsquo;t do that thing, is still another block in the pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is part of where GTD or any other &amp;ldquo;productivity&amp;rdquo; system falls down is that perhaps it assumes you&amp;rsquo;re a reasonable person who gets up at a reasonable time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think such a thing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist if David Allen used Twitter or got distracted 9 times a day by an ocean of Slack notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I should eat my fruit box so I can have energy to go and contribute to the economy or whatever&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Thoughts upon entering my second job in the industry</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/day-one/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the night before my first day with Mercedes-Benz as a Site Reliability Engineer. This post is a sequel to &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/day-xero&#34;&gt;Day Xero&lt;/a&gt;, written a few years back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was never intended to have a follow-up, but it might be a nice reference point to capture how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling each time I&amp;rsquo;m about to enter an entirely foreign environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, that&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;entering-a-new-environment&#34;&gt;Entering a new environment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having spent so long in one place, it&amp;rsquo;s always a strange feeling having to start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good mental model of how this new office looks, or even how big it is. I mean, it seemed sizable from the outside? I suppose as long as I can find the bathroom, the rest doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m not actually concerned about the building, or being lost. If anything, it&amp;rsquo;s quite exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, human nature means you start thinking about all of the unknowns no matter what. How does everyone dress? Am I going to be underdressed? I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be overdressed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically, the bounds of what is acceptable dress code is pretty wide so it&amp;rsquo;s not difficult to find something that&amp;rsquo;ll fit any situation. All you want to do is find something that&amp;rsquo;ll do and then you can scope out the situation from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I expect people to just be specifically wearing business casual, or expect me to be. No one hired me for what I wear. It&amp;rsquo;s also just another office like any other. I think having worked in the same one for ages, I stop thinking of it as an &amp;ldquo;office&amp;rdquo;, or even a &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this whole aspect is stupid. At no point has dress code or anything of the sort come up. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it more than I probably should have which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve left it in and I think a later point might give some insight as to why it even came up in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;imposter-syndrome&#34;&gt;Imposter Syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is a classic and so there&amp;rsquo;s no point hiding it under a wishy-washy title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;m actually feeling pretty good about a fresh start so I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling this very much, but it has popped up here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t even properly met anyone yet but the general communication style has been pretty straight to the point and honest. Even if that didn&amp;rsquo;t turn out to be accurate going forward, I&amp;rsquo;m not really in the business of pretending (much) myself. If I was, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be publishing such a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to think about why I&amp;rsquo;m not too badly affected by imposter syndrome this time out, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s partly due to my general viewpoint on job interviews nowadays. That is, I believe it is job of the interviewer to determine if you&amp;rsquo;re a decent fit for a position or not. The same mentality applies for say; submitting a talk to a conference or entering anything competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, let&amp;rsquo;s say I&amp;rsquo;m not the right person for the job. Just to be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean in a meritocracy sense, because it&amp;rsquo;s questionable whether such a thing exists. In this scenario, imagine I&amp;rsquo;m just not equipped to actually do well and I&amp;rsquo;m still completely lost, even after a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only fair to say that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a failing on my part. As far as a system concerned with hiring someone goes, the fault would lie in the hiring process itself not being rigorous enough. Not only is it not something worth concerning myself with, but it&amp;rsquo;s also something I quite literally have no control or involvement in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;systems&#34;&gt;Systems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a fair bit about my job and what aspects of it I like and don&amp;rsquo;t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming, I think, is pretty cool. The idea of it being a job is something I like and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in getting better as a developer. That said, only to a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to being the best at a particular language, or keeping up with the latest fancy tools, I really don&amp;rsquo;t care to a certain extent. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ll check &amp;rsquo;em out and get somewhat decent but also I don&amp;rsquo;t for a minute think any of this stuff translates directly into a good product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it contribute? Yeah, it can but it&amp;rsquo;s just one small piece of a much larger effort that encompasses relationship building, marketing, support systems and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, all this is to say, I think I find systems in general more interesting than any specifically &amp;ldquo;tech&amp;rdquo;. Systems exist in any discipline and can be anything from a codebase to simply what inputs from eg; a Product Manager result in what outcomes from developers? Why do those inputs come about? Perhaps they&amp;rsquo;re overridden by external parties who wield a bigger stick? Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just bad communication? It&amp;rsquo;s not always clear just by taking a system at face value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all this, I&amp;rsquo;ll be going from one set of systems that I like to think I&amp;rsquo;m at least a little familiar with, to an entirely new environment where I have no idea how or why anything is done the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;ll be fun to poke things and see what outcomes you get as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;brain-dumping&#34;&gt;Brain dumping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought about it quite a bit, which is that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent about 2 1/2 years learning a bunch of things that are highly transferrable but also a whole bunch that definitely aren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every business has their own wacky way of doing things and I don&amp;rsquo;t expect for a minute that a decent amount of information I&amp;rsquo;ve come to think about day to day, will be transferrable or even useful going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t really just think my way into forgetting and I know it&amp;rsquo;ll naturally just fade over time but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to have a big wad of information floating around my head that is suddenly rendered useless almost overnight. At least, it&amp;rsquo;s useless to me anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;backdrop&#34;&gt;Backdrop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing worth mentioning, that I somehow almost forgot, is that Auckland, New Zealand is currently in lockdown which expires at midnight tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I even get inducted into my new job, there&amp;rsquo;ll be a mini-induction to cover how this business specifically deals with COVID-19 issues such as how many people can be in the office and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I was partly responsible for onboarding a few people during our first lockdown with my previous employer and now I&amp;rsquo;ll be on the other side of the fence, being onboarded myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-does-it-feel-uncomfortable-starting-from-scratch&#34;&gt;Why does it feel uncomfortable starting from scratch?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After writing all of the above, I mulled over it a bit and realised something. It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to forget that people come and go all the time when it comes to businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to think there&amp;rsquo;s some sort of spotlight on you when first starting out. You sort of imagine that everyone has been in their roles for hundreds of years and you&amp;rsquo;re joining something that has been humming along just fine without you. Time to prove yourself, recruit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not accurate at all of course. People are poached, hired, fired, resign, change roles and go on extended leave all the time. So common in fact, no one really cares beyond a certain point how a new starter is performing. They&amp;rsquo;ve got their own stuff to deal with, day to day. I know I certainly never paid attention to new people starting in other teams. I forgot some of our new starters in my previous team were just that pretty quickly. There&amp;rsquo;s no reason to think this will be any different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s literally someone&amp;rsquo;s job to handle the setup for new people starting and making sure they can start off being relatively productive. If it was rare, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be someone&amp;rsquo;s job, it&amp;rsquo;d just be an ad hoc process picked up by a group probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s about all I had off the top of my head anyway. None of the above is really useful for me to note down but I figure it might be an interesting series of posts to share with someone just starting out down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like &amp;ldquo;Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty scary starting out but here&amp;rsquo;s a look at how you progress as the years go on. You just naturally sort of figure stuff out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems to happen like that anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just sitting in my head with some popcorn and getting ready to enjoy the show. At some point, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably remember that I&amp;rsquo;m starting from scratch. &amp;ldquo;Oh no&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;ll think, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a week and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t submitted any code&amp;rdquo;, as if code submission somehow proves &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve made it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans in charge of being rational I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Thoughts upon entering my first proper job in the industry</description>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/day-xero/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Technically it&amp;rsquo;s Day 1 of my new job, a Graduate Site Reliability Engineer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xero.com/nz/&#34;&gt;Xero&lt;/a&gt; but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t officially started since I&amp;rsquo;m still on my way to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told myself that when I finally got my first full time development position, I&amp;rsquo;d write a big post mortem about how long it took, how many times I was rejected and all that but since I haven&amp;rsquo;t (yet), this is my offering to the Content Overlords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t even know if I actually slept last night because it felt like most of it was like &amp;ldquo;Oh no, what have I actually learnt over the last year&amp;rdquo; and other rude things from that pesky doubtful voice we all have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excuse me, you silly voice, I&amp;rsquo;ll have you know that I&amp;rsquo;ve used and/or fiddled with ahem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docker.com/&#34;&gt;doc&lt;/a&gt;hi&lt;a href=&#34;https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/&#34;&gt;ask&lt;/a&gt;ydd4h&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/&#34;&gt;py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.djangoproject.com/&#34;&gt;dja&lt;/a&gt;22hf&lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/en/&#34;&gt;nod&lt;/a&gt;j2ve&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npmjs.com/&#34;&gt;n&lt;/a&gt;a43&lt;a href=&#34;https://reactjs.org/&#34;&gt;rea&lt;/a&gt;f&lt;a href=&#34;https://webpack.js.org/&#34;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt;tex&lt;a href=&#34;https://babeljs.io/&#34;&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;gdd0r g&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/neovim/neovim&#34;&gt;neov&lt;/a&gt;1fuh&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;ith&lt;/a&gt;u&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lepture/mistune&#34;&gt;ist&lt;/a&gt;fh&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.archlinux.org/&#34;&gt;rc&lt;/a&gt;8gzvf&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/&#34;&gt;tow&lt;/a&gt;fi&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki&#34;&gt;med&lt;/a&gt;uwh&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Tabber&#34;&gt;tab&lt;/a&gt;f2&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/dotfiles&#34;&gt;do&lt;/a&gt;fq&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tmux/tmux&#34;&gt;tmu&lt;/a&gt;d&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.neomutt.org/&#34;&gt;mu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and let me tell you, MediaWiki is somethingâ€¦ special alright but it&amp;rsquo;s solid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be silly of course to think that somehow knowing a bunch of frameworks and languages will somehow mean I&amp;rsquo;m set for life because that&amp;rsquo;s nonsense talk. It&amp;rsquo;s all about knowing picking the right tool for the right job, y&amp;rsquo;know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do more this year is reading more about actual software stories. I started reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreaming_in_Code&#34;&gt;Dreaming in Code&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year which seems to be a &amp;ldquo;what not to do&amp;rdquo; manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, Scott Rosenberg often veers so far into tangents that half the book feels more like a history lesson than development but that&amp;rsquo;s good! Software won&amp;rsquo;t save you, or the planet, on its own. You gotta focus on the people behind it and getting them working together as a proper team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post isn&amp;rsquo;t actually about anything as you can tell. It&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld&#34;&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt; of posts. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s not true since Seinfeld isn&amp;rsquo;t actually about nothing, it&amp;rsquo;s just a show without drama. It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to just be regular life because your average person doesn&amp;rsquo;t live out &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City&#34;&gt;Sex in the City&lt;/a&gt; on a daily basis. I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually seen that show though, it&amp;rsquo;s just used as a punchline a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure if I look back at today, I&amp;rsquo;ll wonder what I was even worried about. If you think about friends or coworkers, do you even really remember meeting them? It&amp;rsquo;s like as soon as you properly know someone, you just kinda forget any awkward moments before your first interaction. I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s like that with jobs. You just kinda turn up one day and, assuming you try your best, you just kinda slot in nicely as if you&amp;rsquo;d been there the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I better deploy this thing before my taxi gets here. It&amp;rsquo;s still kinda crazy to me that I can just give away the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/site/blob/95ae742bbf33662f4dd4cf284e463d0f9320c8d1/site/posts/blog/2018/2018-02-12-day-xero.md&#34;&gt;actual post file&lt;/a&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re reading with a few entries into a terminal. Yes, I had to manually make that link because this post even in the repo yet! That&amp;rsquo;s like some kinda preemptive sharing, whoaaa mannnnn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who learnt piece by piece, pouring a bunch of hours into Right Click -&amp;gt; View Page Source, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to give my own stuff back. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember who said it or when but someone once said something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t write code, I merely borrow it.&amp;rdquo; Their point wasn&amp;rsquo;t that they spend all day on Stack Overflow but rather that none of their ideas are truly original. Nothing is original because it&amp;rsquo;s all inspired by things that came before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, ok, my time is actually almost up and while I&amp;rsquo;m a bit freaked out that I&amp;rsquo;ll be diving into my first full time software job after years of being a hobbyist, there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that I try to remind myself. I might not truly know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing but neither does anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone else once told me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults are just kids who got older&lt;/p&gt;
