      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I like to &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/nz-oia-guide/&#34;&gt;submit requests under the Official Information Act&lt;/a&gt; and see what fun datasets I can get my hands on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of these projects end up on the back burner and &lt;a href=&#34;https://towing.utf9k.net&#34;&gt;towing.utf9k.net&lt;/a&gt; was no different. Before we get too far, you might want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/projects/towing/&#34;&gt;read this brief overview&lt;/a&gt; about what it does to build some context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All up, it took me something like 4 or 5 years to finally consider it &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo;, in large part because I would hit a wall and not really be sure where to go from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With perfect 20/20 hindsight, such a project would be very quick to complete but for those starting out in the mapping space, taking a scenic walk through the creation process should hopefully serve as a nice jumping off point for how you might approach your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I kept all of my &amp;ldquo;workings&amp;rdquo; like as my cobbled together Python scripts and intermediate datasets, such that we can work through them from start to finish so you can have an idea of how this fun little visualisation was made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably worth noting that I&amp;rsquo;m not a data scientist by any means and a lot of steps could probably be made redundant if I knew better but it&amp;rsquo;s all a means to an end, and the end is pretty neat so I don&amp;rsquo;t really mind airing my dirty laundry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-inspiration&#34;&gt;Obtaining inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the hardest step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/projects/towing/&#34;&gt;brief project write up&lt;/a&gt;, the idea for a towing visualisation came to me when I was sitting at a cafe. I don&amp;rsquo;t imagine I would have come up with the idea any other way so it was basically a fluke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next best thing is seeing what other cool creations are floating around online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled on has come by way of &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise it at the time, but I think a few of my favourites that stick out have all come from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/foiachap&#34;&gt;Matt Chapman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mchap.io/using-foia-data-and-unix-to-halve-major-source-of-parking-tickets.html&#34;&gt;Using FOIA Data and Unix to halve major source of parking tickets&lt;/a&gt; was a particularly big inspiration on &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/projects/parnell/&#34;&gt;this smaller project of mine&lt;/a&gt; which ended up going in a different direction than what he had put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at it after all these years, and having a few pieces under my belt, I feel like there&amp;rsquo;s even more to improve in my own process so writing this post in itself has already been a big win for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, all this to say: As is usually the case, starting is often harder than any other part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the ball is rolling, you may hit some hard problems but I find it&amp;rsquo;s usually rare that they&amp;rsquo;re difficult in the sense of an immovable object. It&amp;rsquo;s more that it&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of work or figuring out the right terminology to use in a search query that will get you a step closer to the right tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s actually take a look at the project in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-our-dataset&#34;&gt;Obtaining our dataset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part varies depending on what type of data you&amp;rsquo;re looking for and depending on the country you&amp;rsquo;re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in New Zealand, we have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/nz-oia-guide/&#34;&gt;Official Information Act&lt;/a&gt; which defaults to everything being open unless there is a good reason for it not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, we have &lt;a href=&#34;https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset&#34;&gt;some pretty proactive agencies continuously publishing interesting datasets&lt;/a&gt; so not everything necessarily requires a formal request either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I was after data about vehicles that were towed in Auckland City which is not readily available, at least as far as I&amp;rsquo;m aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the correct authority can be a bit of a wild goose chase when you&amp;rsquo;re first starting out but most agencies should be pretty helpful in letting you know where the data you&amp;rsquo;re after might be held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I did a search for &lt;code&gt;auckland transport towing&lt;/code&gt; which surfaced &lt;a href=&#34;https://at.govt.nz/driving-parking/parking-rules/towing/&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; and I noticed an interesting mention near the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT contractors and private towing companies must notify police when they have towed a vehicle. They are required to provide the licence plate number and location they have moved the vehicle to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured contacting the New Zealand Police might be worth a shot in case they happened to hold more comprehensive information than Auckland Transport themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, they transferred my request to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.watercare.co.nz/Contact/Official-information-request&#34;&gt;LGOIMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Business Partner which I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have known was the right place, but most agencies are pretty good at redirecting you where you should go like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read &lt;a href=&#34;https://fyi.org.nz/request/11018-request-of-towing-data-for-three-tamaki-makaurau-police-districts&#34;&gt;the full correspondence&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea of how to structure a request, what some of the back and forth might look like, and to get a copy of the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our dataset on hand, let&amp;rsquo;s fire it up and take a look at what we&amp;rsquo;ve got to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-our-dataset-palatable&#34;&gt;Making our dataset palatable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening up &lt;code&gt;Marcus Aug 2016 Jul 2019.xlsx&lt;/code&gt; certainly leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;./spreadsheet.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of an Excel spreadsheet. There are many workbooks which each contain data for a specific year between 2016 and 2019. The data is formatted visually but will be a huge pain to access programmatically.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With just an initial glance, we can already spot a bunch of pain points with this data set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This dataset will be hard to query programmatically. In the &lt;code&gt;Date and Time&lt;/code&gt; column for instance, we have a mix of times and dates. If you were to take a random row, you would need to step back &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; number of rows to figure out the date and then apply that date to each row going forward, until you hit the next cell that resembles a date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addresses do not have much consistency.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some addresses include street numbers while others do not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of them contain suburbs so we may have address clashes with no way to know the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terms like &lt;code&gt;OPP&lt;/code&gt; in the case of &amp;ldquo;Opposite 55 Ngapuhi Road&amp;rdquo; which don&amp;rsquo;t tell us anything useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file column contains numbers that we need to map to something meaningful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least two visible entries have a vehicle starting from the same street they end up in
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps they were towed around the block or moved to unblock something? The data doesn&amp;rsquo;t say so we can only assume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first iteration of this project, I decided to ignore any information that would be hard to interpret so missing street numbers and the like were put to one side just to get things moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this step, I reached for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pandas.pydata.org/&#34;&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt; to create a hacky script that brute forced this dataset into something nice and easy to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is generally nice for these sorts of explorations, not only because it has a strong data science library but the lack of strong typing makes it easy to cludge together a project when your underlying data is a complete mess, structurally speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/tidying-towing-data/&#34;&gt;The entire process was detailed step by step&lt;/a&gt; on my blog a few years back. I had gotten as far as tidying the data but was a bit stumped on how to make anything usable out of it at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the impatient, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/main/auckland-towing/sheet_to_db.py&#34;&gt;this script&lt;/a&gt; is all you need to skim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s jump ahead to the end of that post which leaves us with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/index.html&#34;&gt;sqlite&lt;/a&gt; database called &lt;code&gt;towing.db&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geocoding---what-is-it&#34;&gt;Geocoding - what is it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we have a nice queryable list of addresses, they don&amp;rsquo;t actually mean anything to us in plain English. What we really want is a list of coordinates that we can plot on a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of taking an address and transforming it into a set of coordinates is known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_geocoding&#34;&gt;Address geocoding&lt;/a&gt;, or just &amp;ldquo;geocoding&amp;rdquo; for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we aren&amp;rsquo;t doing it in this project, it might be interesting to know that the reverse process of taking a set of coordinates and turning it into the nearest address is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system#Reverse_geocoding&#34;&gt;Reverse geocoding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do we go about geocoding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there are a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview&#34;&gt;geocoding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.here.com/documentation/geocoding-search-api/dev_guide/index.html&#34;&gt;providers&lt;/a&gt; that you could turn to but we have a pretty sizeable dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sqlite&#34; data-lang=&#34;sqlite&#34;&gt;sqlite&amp;gt; SELECT count(*) FROM events;
count(*) = 49174
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.here.com/get-started/pricing&#34;&gt;HERE Maps&lt;/a&gt; as an example, our dataset falls within the &lt;code&gt;30,001 to 5,000,000&lt;/code&gt; requests/month category giving us a cost of &lt;code&gt;0.830&lt;/code&gt; USD per 1000 requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll round it up to 50,000 to account for some API failures and network connectivity issues on our end and we&amp;rsquo;re looking at around $40 USD. Admittedly, that is a lot cheaper than I remember. Perhaps the prices have come down a lot since I last looked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Mapbox, it seems this would &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/#search&#34;&gt;even fall within their free tier&lt;/a&gt; so I would probably just go that route if I was starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing to consider is how many requests can you make before hitting a rate limit since you have to send every address across the wire, whether batched or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we&amp;rsquo;re going to do it all locally for free in exchange for a bit of elbow grease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geocoding---doing-it-in-practice&#34;&gt;Geocoding - Doing it in practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need a dataset that will translate addresses to coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in New Zealand, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linz.govt.nz/&#34;&gt;Land Information New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; provides this and many other datasets for free, by way of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linz.govt.nz/products-services/data/linz-data-service&#34;&gt;LINZ Data Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;./lds.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the LINZ Data Service, a web browser for viewing map layers and other types of data sets. In this image, the NZ Addresses dataset is selected and partly visible on the right side of the screen. On the left side is the LDS data set browser.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;rsquo;re looking at is one data point for each address in New Zealand that contains both the address broken into its component parts as well as the coordinates for that address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, we&amp;rsquo;ll download the dataset as a CSV and using &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/&#34;&gt;sqlite-utils&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://datasette.io/&#34;&gt;Datasette&lt;/a&gt; project, we can &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/main/auckland-towing/import_addresses.sh#L4&#34;&gt;insert the contents into our existing sqlite database&lt;/a&gt; which will let us perform joins between our two datasets down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick way to &amp;ldquo;geocode&amp;rdquo; is to just take all these addresses and then do a rough lookup to find an address that matches each one of our towing addresses. All that&amp;rsquo;s left is to check the associated coordinates if we get a match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, I would probably look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pelias/pelias&#34;&gt;Pelias&lt;/a&gt; as a middle ground although I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/765e97df94daa053f87970496d53ce9f50c21c39/auckland-towing/match-events-to-addresses.py&#34;&gt;a bit more data munging&lt;/a&gt;, we have a script that does exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to improve the odds of a match occurring, I added in some brute force checks to transform the most common abbreviations into their full names such as &lt;code&gt;st&lt;/code&gt; becoming &lt;code&gt;street&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process was quite lossy, as seen by the number of addresses that I wrote out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/765e97df94daa053f87970496d53ce9f50c21c39/auckland-towing/failures.txt&#34;&gt;a text file containing failed translations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the sheer number of originating data points, I didn&amp;rsquo;t worry about this too much since there&amp;rsquo;d be more than enough results to play with but it might be interesting to fix up a lot of the leftovers sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, our matching pair of addresses were &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/765e97df94daa053f87970496d53ce9f50c21c39/auckland-towing/trips.csv&#34;&gt;output to a CSV file&lt;/a&gt; for quick lookup in the next bit of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary but I figured that it would allow for quicker lookups iterating through a CSV file than having to perform joins between our two tables for every event. As with all things in this messy process, as long as it gets us to our final destination, doing it &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;translating-our-coordinates-into-routes&#34;&gt;Translating our coordinates into routes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have a set of start and end coordinates that represent where a vehicle was towed from and where it ended up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good start but if we were to plot these on a map and then start simulating traffic between those two points, we would get something silly like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;./map-direct.png&#34; alt=&#34;A Mapbox map layer showing Newmarket, Auckland, New Zealand. There are two numbered points on opposite sides of the map with a line going straight from one to the other.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that cars don&amp;rsquo;t work this way in real life, just cutting through buildings and chunks of lands, so we somehow need to simulate the route that a vehicle is most likely to take so we have something more like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;./map-points.png&#34; alt=&#34;A Mapbox map layer showing Newmarket, Auckland, New Zealand. There are many numbered points, each at main intersections of the map with lines joining between them. It roughly follows the path that a car might drive.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how to generate routing data was a massive blocker for this project for a long time until I discovered the existence of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice&#34;&gt;openrouteservice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it&amp;rsquo;s a Java service that can be run locally in order to generate routing information. Better yet, it has a JSON API where you can submit coordinates and receive back structured routing information which is exactly what we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We specifically want the &lt;code&gt;/ors/v2/directions/driving-car&lt;/code&gt; endpoint to generate direction for a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to go even further, it might be interesting to gather average traffic data to simulate the speed to might take to drive down any given road but to make life easier, I just generated some fake timestamps that incremented by 2 seconds for each route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this is because the routes are actually very detailed, even more so than we need for our visualisation so we end up with a lot of navigation directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/765e97df94daa053f87970496d53ce9f50c21c39/auckland-towing/trips-to-vis.py&#34;&gt;we can put together another script&lt;/a&gt; that slowly iterates through our dataset and saves the resulting output into a file called &lt;code&gt;routes.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a bit of a weird format but don&amp;rsquo;t read too much into it. It&amp;rsquo;s just specific to the visualisation library that we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-together-our-visualisation&#34;&gt;Putting together our visualisation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a great deal of visualisation tools out there but one I had been meaning to try for some time is &lt;a href=&#34;https://deck.gl/&#34;&gt;deck.gl&lt;/a&gt;, a WebGL framework by Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly, I had come across their &lt;a href=&#34;https://deck.gl/examples/trips-layer&#34;&gt;TripsLayer demo&lt;/a&gt; some time back. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall but I probably saw the demo and thought it was exactly what I had in mind for how a representation of this towing data might look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the source code for all of the demo is available, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/tree/8.9-release/examples/website/trips&#34;&gt;including TripsLayer&lt;/a&gt;, so rather than reinvent the wheel, I took what was already released and restructured my dataset to fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did rip out some bits of the source code and made other tweaks but for the most part, the fundamentals didn&amp;rsquo;t change greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our &lt;code&gt;routes.json&lt;/code&gt; file generated in the last step, plugging the new data set in and spinning up the project gave us a nice, albeit a bit boring map to look out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our project was complete&amp;hellip; or was it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to the sheer number of data points in the graph, the visualisation was sluggish at best and near unusable on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from publishing the project and sharing it around with some colleagues but I was never quite happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward another year and I finally sat down to make some performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cutting-through-the-acres-of-data-points&#34;&gt;Cutting through the acres of data points&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a diagnosis to make other than &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s too much dang data&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than try anything fancy, I continued the theme of the brute force approach and took a machete to the dataset, slimming it down greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking from tradition, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/765e97df94daa053f87970496d53ce9f50c21c39/auckland-towing/slim-down-routes.go&#34;&gt;wrote a quick program in Go&lt;/a&gt; because I felt that it would have a better change of succeeding in a reasonable time frame than something based in Python, not to mention we now had a well-structured dataset to make life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a high level, the script kept the first and last data points for each route taken and randomly deleted all of the points in between until just 10 were left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemed like it would break everything but it had the reverse effect. Not only did the performance greatly improve but the graph looked much cooler as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing this whole exercise exposed me to a lot of new mapping concepts such as geocoding, visualisation, route generation as well as some various tools for munging together data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say I&amp;rsquo;m glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t give up but more than anything, this project was an open loop in my mind that had finally beaten me, and that will usually always be enough to keep me coming back for more punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the coolest outcome is that because it&amp;rsquo;s visual, you can pop up a project like this on your phone and show people who might think it&amp;rsquo;s cool without necessarily having much background into what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably the one category of programming I do that&amp;rsquo;s closest to art in any sense which always helps to keep the perpetual motion machine running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wish it was easier to come by good ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hopefully you learned something useful reading this post and if you come across any better tools that I could have made use of earlier, please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to let me know at &lt;code&gt;hello@utf9k.net&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy mapping!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Who is software even for?</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/who-is-software-even-for/</link>
      <description>Maybe it&#39;s for you? Maybe it&#39;s for me? Maybe it isn&#39;t for any of us!</description>

      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/who-is-software-even-for/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post is very much written spur of the moment, presumably with the idea that it will help contribute to treating my blog as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/zettelkasten-blog-a-good-idea/&#34;&gt;zettlekasten&lt;/a&gt; of ideas to think more about in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374159122&#34;&gt;Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals&lt;/a&gt; earlier today and I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the name, it&amp;rsquo;s very much not a self help book and instead is about accepting the inevitability of death. If you can manage that, you&amp;rsquo;ll come to truly understand that this idea that you can do, or manage everything on your plate is a big lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an entirely unrelated note, I went to get a kebab just before and I was thinking about how most software doesn&amp;rsquo;t really feel designed for fallible humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particular scenario is that I quite like using &lt;a href=&#34;https://feedbin.com/&#34;&gt;Feedbin&lt;/a&gt; as my RSS reader but if I go for an extended period of time without actually reading anything, it piles up until I have something like a thousand unread items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is a false idea. I am not going to read 1000 items and a lot of them are small snippets such as Hacker News comment feeds but perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really wonder is why there isn&amp;rsquo;t a button to say &amp;ldquo;I was sick for 2 weeks and please just surface my most prioritised feeds&amp;rdquo;. In the absence of such a thing, I&amp;rsquo;m left to curse myself for not being a fallible robot and if only I had put in the work, in periodic chunks, each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going even further off this idea, it does kind of feel like most software is not really designed for humans. Particularly, mere mortals who get sick or are distracted easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, systems that start out being able to ease stress can become much more daunting when you forget the underlying concepts that back them. Worse still, you might have valuable information &amp;ldquo;stuck&amp;rdquo; in them so you&amp;rsquo;re trapped at the mercy of remastering a system once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, it&amp;rsquo;s wading through the depths of a messy &amp;ldquo;task management&amp;rdquo; system only to throw my hands up in the air. It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to start with a fresh new competitor that will totally not get messy and I will check in every single day to keep things curated I swear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either further still, if this feeling is even somewhat true, it raises the question then: &amp;ldquo;Who is software even for?&amp;rdquo; because it can often feel like it&amp;rsquo;s built for idealised humans, if not gods, who remember every CLI flag and have the energy to parse acres of manpages. Anything less feels like treating water because you can&amp;rsquo;t express your will through your fingers in any redeeming fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m being a bit ridiculous and speaking in broad strokes here but I do feel this way from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we pretend that it is true for a bit, just think how many billions, no, trillions have been wasted on lopsided shit that isn&amp;rsquo;t really enhancing anything for anyone. Maybe for bursts of time but in the grand scheme of things? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was about the extent of my soul searching before I made it back home anyway. I still need to eat my dinner which is probably getting cold by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up, Four Thousand Weeks would have you know that the answer is also not dedicating your life to endless vacation either because that too is simply just another form of trying to feel endlessly productive by another means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting down and just doing what&amp;rsquo;s enjoyable, because you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have time at all is about the best anyone can strive towards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, that should really mean touching less software and being Less Online but adjusting yourself to truly believe it in your bones is the hardest part of all, especially with the addictive nature of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think expressing it in writing helps and I can always come back here to remind myself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Has Bootstrap eaten the world yet?</title>

      <description>The CSS framework that could</description>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 20:48:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/has-bootstrap-eaten-the-world-yet/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To quote everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2012/10/03/inside-andreessen-horowitz-15-million-investment-in-rap-genius/?sh=7c7d895f4da2&#34;&gt;rap enthusiast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://a16z.com/author/marc-andreessen/&#34;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Software is eating the world&amp;rdquo; but I&amp;rsquo;d like to coin my own term in that vein: &amp;ldquo;Bootstrap is eating the world&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, perhaps it already has but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting seeing it pop up in real life from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few days, I remember seeing it styling the backend calendar system for the gym that I go to and also powering the patient search when I went to get a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are only two anecdotal instances of course but I wonder just how many systems are floating around the place that are plowing through work with that instantly recognisable basic Bootstrap template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My assumption is that it has continued to succeed because it still primarily caters to getting started as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://getbootstrap.com&#34;&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;, the two links for CSS and JS are right there for use straight out of the box. Similarly, they still distribute single static files too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like most CSS frameworks are only accessible via &lt;a href=&#34;https://npmjs.com&#34;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; with CDN-hosted stylesheets going the way of the dodo so it makes sense that people who choose bootstrap would stick with it. Lack of complexity is effectively a feature after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just imagine how much more productive the planet would be if we just doubled down on Bootstrap and threw away all of the other frontend tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dropbox is way too clingy</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/dropbox-is-way-too-clingy/</link>
      <description>A post in which I post about how involved the Dropbox cancellation process is.</description>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:50:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/dropbox-is-way-too-clingy/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As much as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; is great on a technical level, the user experience keeps degrading all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing it is a complete nightmare of clicking through super slow window transitions and banners begging you to upgrade your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I went through the process of deleting my account (again) out of frustration only to find that the already lengthy process had gotten even longer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through the deletion process as it stands in April 2021 and see how many clicks it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the file viewer area, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to click on your profile picture (&lt;strong&gt;First click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;01-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of the upper right corner of the Dropbox main view. The authors account is visible and the Settings button is highlighted.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the dropbown, click on Settings (&lt;strong&gt;Second click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;02-inside-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Dropbox account settings. There are a variety of radio buttons and tabs but the main item of interest is a link at the bottom titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;re inside the Settings menu, click on Delete account (&lt;strong&gt;Third click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be it&amp;hellip; right? Done. Simple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;03-first-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;A page asking the author if they would like to downgrade. It says that the author has to downgrade their account, that they&amp;amp;rsquo;ll lose a bunch of storage and lists some consequences such as &amp;amp;ldquo;Dropbox will stop syncing&amp;amp;rdquo;. At the bottom are two buttons, one in blue that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I changed my mind, take me back to Dropbox&amp;amp;rdquo; and one in white that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I still want to downgrade&amp;amp;rdquo;. The downgrade button is clearly what the user is after but the colour coding makes it tricky since the &amp;amp;ldquo;I don&amp;amp;rsquo;t want to cancel&amp;amp;rdquo; one is more prominent.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we really have to, I can handle putting up with one of these pages but come on, the colour coding of these buttons is clearly a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.darkpatterns.org/&#34;&gt;dark pattern&lt;/a&gt;. I clicked a button called &amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;rdquo; and now the primary action on this page is &amp;ldquo;I changed my mind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the wording that suggests I need to cancel my subscription is odd, in that deleting an account is surely the same act as cancelling a subscription.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Yes, I realise I&amp;rsquo;m not using this service I paid for. I don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, we resist the urge and click on &amp;ldquo;I still want to downgrade&amp;rdquo;, which weirdly does not say &amp;ldquo;Complete downgrade&amp;rdquo;. You know what that means&amp;hellip; (&lt;strong&gt;Fourth click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;04-second-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;A pop up modal asking if the author still wants to cancel. It has a bunch of radio buttons with reasons for cancellation, with the author having selected one that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I found another product I liked better&amp;amp;rdquo;. There is a button labelled &amp;amp;ldquo;Skip&amp;amp;rdquo; in the bottom left and two buttons on the bottom right. They read &amp;amp;ldquo;Don&amp;amp;rsquo;t cancel&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Continue cancelling&amp;amp;rdquo;. Strangely, &amp;amp;ldquo;Continue cancelling&amp;amp;rdquo; is the more prominent of the two, unlike the previous page.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God, yes! I&amp;rsquo;m two screens deep already so I&amp;rsquo;m pretty fucking sure I would like to cancel. I&amp;rsquo;m not &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; of leaving, I already decided that when you started degrading the UI. You could have just shipped nothing for the next 5 years and continued to make bank through word of mouth and the quality of your sync engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, even just the lock-in from existing applications already does most of the convincing for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting, the colour coding has switched once again to suggest that &amp;ldquo;Continue canceling&amp;rdquo; is now the primary action. Is this to trick me into not cancelling? I also didn&amp;rsquo;t notice that &amp;ldquo;Skip&amp;rdquo; option in the bottom left until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Fifth and sixth clicks&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;05-third-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;Another page with the title &amp;amp;ldquo;Dropbox Plus is so much more than just space&amp;amp;rdquo; and presents some alleged reasons to stay like &amp;amp;ldquo;Easy sharing&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Large storage volume&amp;amp;rdquo;. These are the same bullet points, roughly, as the earlier page. At the bottom are two buttons, a prominent blue one on the left titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Keep Dropbox Plus&amp;amp;rdquo; and a transparent, less obvious one on the right titled &amp;amp;ldquo;I still want to downgrade&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many fonts does Dropbox use? None of these screens are even consistent whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a problem with the product, I have a problem with the marketing department so none of this is helping. If anything, it has the opposite effect of making me want to cancel even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colour coding has changed yet again to suggest &amp;ldquo;Keep Dropbox Plus&amp;rdquo; is the primary action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Seventh click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;06-final-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;Yet another page titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Before you go, Marcus&amp;amp;hellip;&amp;amp;rdquo;, addressed to the author. It has a large blue button in the middle of the screen that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I changed my mind, take me back to Dropbox&amp;amp;rdquo;. There is another button for cancelling somewhere off screen that is not visible to the reader. The rest of the page just roughly lists the same claimed features as previous pages.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT DO YOU MEAN BEFORE I GO? THIS IS LITERALLY THE SAME INFORMATION PRESENTED FOR THE THIRD TIME. HOW IS THIS A CONVINCING ARGUMENT? I DON&amp;rsquo;T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU AREN&amp;rsquo;T EVEN TRYING.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t even see the cancel button on this page. You have to scroll right to the bottom (which I didn&amp;rsquo;t screenshot) and then click another cancel button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Eighth click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;07-done.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of a green banner that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;Account downgraded. Thanks for your feedback.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now originally, this is where I had ended the blog post but I actually went back to Dropbox a few weeks later&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and just discovered this process hadn&amp;rsquo;t even deleted my account. All I accomplished was that I downgraded my plan which is obvious in hindsight but also, why this much friction just to downgrade a plan then? Just what sort of nightmare will it take to delete my account and do businesses have to go through this hell if you purchase an enterprise plan?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;08-banner.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of a red banner that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;You are scheduled to downgrade.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s finish this thing off for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the home page, we once again click on the user profile and then on Settings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;01-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of the upper right corner of the Dropbox main view. The authors account is visible and the Settings button is highlighted.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Ninth and tenth clicks&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once more, hit the &amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;rdquo; button at the bottom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;02-inside-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Dropbox account settings. There are a variety of radio buttons and tabs but the main item of interest is a link at the bottom titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Eleventh click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;09-delete.png&#34; alt=&#34;A form that says &amp;amp;ldquo;Permanently delete your Dropbox account&amp;amp;rdquo; with three inputs: one for your password, one for your reason for leaving and a third to enter in more details.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; more clicks to fill in this shitty form and that brings us up to &lt;strong&gt;seventeen clicks&lt;/strong&gt; when I hit &amp;ldquo;Permanently delete&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;10-free.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of a black banner that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;Your account has been deleted. We&amp;amp;rsquo;re sorry to see you go.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No company that did this sort of shit ever made me feel excited or even curious about coming back. To this day, I have never resubscribed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com&#34;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; purely because their cancellation policy requires you to ring a human person in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would anyone do this sort of thing? It just screams disbelief in your own product. If you&amp;rsquo;re so scared of people leaving, it makes me wonder just what kind of mess you&amp;rsquo;re hiding under the rug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there&amp;rsquo;s only one thing I have to say to Dropbox after all this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HhnUK1YmMEU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently not as I later found out.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By which I mean, just now.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once on the password field, a second on a popup to autofill from my password manager, a third to open the &amp;ldquo;Reasons for leaving&amp;rdquo; dropdown, a fourth to select a reason, a fifth to start entering &amp;ldquo;More details&amp;rdquo; and the sixth is when I hit &amp;ldquo;Permanently delete&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Address book sorting</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/address-book-sorting/</link>
      <description>The macOS and iOS address book leaves a bit to be desired</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 22:48:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/address-book-sorting/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I boot up an Apple device for the first time, it always strikes me as annoying to find that the address book is sorted by last name first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about this further, I think the frustration stems from my being more unfamiliar with last names than first. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I don&amp;rsquo;t know their last names either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a lookup issue in the sense that I have to visualise the full name of a person and then break off the end chunk and put it first. That is, in a sense that&amp;rsquo;s what my brain is doing rather than jumping straight to their first name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do wonder if last names are less commonly used? For example, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time I ever referred to someone by their last name ie Ms. Blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would partly chalk that up to a mix of my age, tendency to hate overly formal things and my general professional which is&amp;hellip; not traditionally professional shall we say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, I tend to think of people by their first names and I always dig out that setting and turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be that it&amp;rsquo;s more the realm of business people, who have more formal connections (and business cards) than I do. For that reason, it might be that they don&amp;rsquo;t tend to use first names as prominently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could google search it, and I will, but before then it makes me wonder how many other default settings are considered weird to other people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autocorrection is another one where I find that I need to toggle off all the assistance features or I&amp;rsquo;ll be driven mad. I prefer my screen real estate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s a committee of address book creators too, who uphold the guidelines of what makes a good address book. I&amp;rsquo;m just speculating at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to know what other default settings bug you! You can let me know through the variety of different mediums in the footer below.&lt;/p&gt;
