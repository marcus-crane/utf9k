      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As much as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; is great on a technical level, the user experience keeps degrading all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing it is a complete nightmare of clicking through super slow window transitions and banners begging you to upgrade your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I went through the process of deleting my account (again) out of frustration only to find that the already lengthy process had gotten even longer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through the deletion process as it stands in April 2021 and see how many clicks it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the file viewer area, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to click on your profile picture (&lt;strong&gt;First click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;01-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of the upper right corner of the Dropbox main view. The authors account is visible and the Settings button is highlighted.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the dropbown, click on Settings (&lt;strong&gt;Second click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;02-inside-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Dropbox account settings. There are a variety of radio buttons and tabs but the main item of interest is a link at the bottom titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;re inside the Settings menu, click on Delete account (&lt;strong&gt;Third click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be it&amp;hellip; right? Done. Simple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;03-first-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;A page asking the author if they would like to downgrade. It says that the author has to downgrade their account, that they&amp;amp;rsquo;ll lose a bunch of storage and lists some consequences such as &amp;amp;ldquo;Dropbox will stop syncing&amp;amp;rdquo;. At the bottom are two buttons, one in blue that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I changed my mind, take me back to Dropbox&amp;amp;rdquo; and one in white that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I still want to downgrade&amp;amp;rdquo;. The downgrade button is clearly what the user is after but the colour coding makes it tricky since the &amp;amp;ldquo;I don&amp;amp;rsquo;t want to cancel&amp;amp;rdquo; one is more prominent.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we really have to, I can handle putting up with one of these pages but come on, the colour coding of these buttons is clearly a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.darkpatterns.org/&#34;&gt;dark pattern&lt;/a&gt;. I clicked a button called &amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;rdquo; and now the primary action on this page is &amp;ldquo;I changed my mind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the wording that suggests I need to cancel my subscription is odd, in that deleting an account is surely the same act as cancelling a subscription.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Yes, I realise I&amp;rsquo;m not using this service I paid for. I don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, we resist the urge and click on &amp;ldquo;I still want to downgrade&amp;rdquo;, which weirdly does not say &amp;ldquo;Complete downgrade&amp;rdquo;. You know what that means&amp;hellip; (&lt;strong&gt;Fourth click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;04-second-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;A pop up modal asking if the author still wants to cancel. It has a bunch of radio buttons with reasons for cancellation, with the author having selected one that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I found another product I liked better&amp;amp;rdquo;. There is a button labelled &amp;amp;ldquo;Skip&amp;amp;rdquo; in the bottom left and two buttons on the bottom right. They read &amp;amp;ldquo;Don&amp;amp;rsquo;t cancel&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Continue cancelling&amp;amp;rdquo;. Strangely, &amp;amp;ldquo;Continue cancelling&amp;amp;rdquo; is the more prominent of the two, unlike the previous page.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God, yes! I&amp;rsquo;m two screens deep already so I&amp;rsquo;m pretty fucking sure I would like to cancel. I&amp;rsquo;m not &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; of leaving, I already decided that when you started degrading the UI. You could have just shipped nothing for the next 5 years and continued to make bank through word of mouth and the quality of your sync engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, even just the lock-in from existing applications already does most of the convincing for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting, the colour coding has switched once again to suggest that &amp;ldquo;Continue canceling&amp;rdquo; is now the primary action. Is this to trick me into not cancelling? I also didn&amp;rsquo;t notice that &amp;ldquo;Skip&amp;rdquo; option in the bottom left until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Fifth and sixth clicks&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;05-third-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;Another page with the title &amp;amp;ldquo;Dropbox Plus is so much more than just space&amp;amp;rdquo; and presents some alleged reasons to stay like &amp;amp;ldquo;Easy sharing&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Large storage volume&amp;amp;rdquo;. These are the same bullet points, roughly, as the earlier page. At the bottom are two buttons, a prominent blue one on the left titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Keep Dropbox Plus&amp;amp;rdquo; and a transparent, less obvious one on the right titled &amp;amp;ldquo;I still want to downgrade&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many fonts does Dropbox use? None of these screens are even consistent whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a problem with the product, I have a problem with the marketing department so none of this is helping. If anything, it has the opposite effect of making me want to cancel even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colour coding has changed yet again to suggest &amp;ldquo;Keep Dropbox Plus&amp;rdquo; is the primary action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Seventh click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;06-final-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;Yet another page titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Before you go, Marcus&amp;amp;hellip;&amp;amp;rdquo;, addressed to the author. It has a large blue button in the middle of the screen that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I changed my mind, take me back to Dropbox&amp;amp;rdquo;. There is another button for cancelling somewhere off screen that is not visible to the reader. The rest of the page just roughly lists the same claimed features as previous pages.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT DO YOU MEAN BEFORE I GO? THIS IS LITERALLY THE SAME INFORMATION PRESENTED FOR THE THIRD TIME. HOW IS THIS A CONVINCING ARGUMENT? I DON&amp;rsquo;T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU AREN&amp;rsquo;T EVEN TRYING.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t even see the cancel button on this page. You have to scroll right to the bottom (which I didn&amp;rsquo;t screenshot) and then click another cancel button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Eighth click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;07-done.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of a green banner that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;Account downgraded. Thanks for your feedback.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now originally, this is where I had ended the blog post but I actually went back to Dropbox a few weeks later&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and just discovered this process hadn&amp;rsquo;t even deleted my account. All I accomplished was that I downgraded my plan which is obvious in hindsight but also, why this much friction just to downgrade a plan then? Just what sort of nightmare will it take to delete my account and do businesses have to go through this hell if you purchase an enterprise plan?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;08-banner.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of a red banner that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;You are scheduled to downgrade.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s finish this thing off for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the home page, we once again click on the user profile and then on Settings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;01-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of the upper right corner of the Dropbox main view. The authors account is visible and the Settings button is highlighted.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Ninth and tenth clicks&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once more, hit the &amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;rdquo; button at the bottom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;02-inside-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Dropbox account settings. There are a variety of radio buttons and tabs but the main item of interest is a link at the bottom titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Eleventh click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;09-delete.png&#34; alt=&#34;A form that says &amp;amp;ldquo;Permanently delete your Dropbox account&amp;amp;rdquo; with three inputs: one for your password, one for your reason for leaving and a third to enter in more details.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; more clicks to fill in this shitty form and that brings us up to &lt;strong&gt;seventeen clicks&lt;/strong&gt; when I hit &amp;ldquo;Permanently delete&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;10-free.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of a black banner that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;Your account has been deleted. We&amp;amp;rsquo;re sorry to see you go.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No company that did this sort of shit ever made me feel excited or even curious about coming back. To this day, I have never resubscribed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com&#34;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; purely because their cancellation policy requires you to ring a human person in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would anyone do this sort of thing? It just screams disbelief in your own product. If you&amp;rsquo;re so scared of people leaving, it makes me wonder just what kind of mess you&amp;rsquo;re hiding under the rug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there&amp;rsquo;s only one thing I have to say to Dropbox after all this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HhnUK1YmMEU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently not as I later found out.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By which I mean, just now.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once on the password field, a second on a popup to autofill from my password manager, a third to open the &amp;ldquo;Reasons for leaving&amp;rdquo; dropdown, a fourth to select a reason, a fifth to start entering &amp;ldquo;More details&amp;rdquo; and the sixth is when I hit &amp;ldquo;Permanently delete&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Starbucks Rewards or: Whether a Coffee Shop Can Be a Third Place</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/starbucks-rewards-third-place/</link>
      <description>A post in which I ramble about Starbucks and how if you squint, it&#39;s a place that some people treat as their second home.</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 13:21:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/starbucks-rewards-third-place/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like all non-technical blog posts I write, the ones that get published are often a spur of the moment reaction to something I just saw or experienced. In this case, I was visiting a Starbucks location here in New Zealand and learned an annoying qualifier about the recently introduced Starbucks Rewards system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any international readers, Starbucks doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a huge presence here in New Zealand. As of 2018, the total number of stores had dropped from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/106769552/restaurant-brands-sells-starbucks-coffee-in-nz&#34;&gt;nearly 50 to 22&lt;/a&gt; with a majority of those being within key cities such as Auckland and Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly a coffee connoisseur, I do know that they&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to carve out a portion of the market due to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.is/pXeER&#34;&gt;strong coffee culture&lt;/a&gt; both here and across the ocean in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the sale of Starbucks from Restaurant Brands to Tahua Partners, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://heartofthecity.co.nz/dining/coffee/starbucks-coffee&#34;&gt;recent renovation of their flagship Queen Street store&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in as I write this, it seems that they&amp;rsquo;ve started taking a different course than the prior owners who just sort of had it plodding along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the outside, it seems that they&amp;rsquo;re attempting to take the high ground by giving off a premium, polished appearance rather than the budget, store-on-every-corner approach that found huge success in America. Most of my evidence of this is purely anecdotal in the form of &amp;ldquo;Well, all of the new stores look fancy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;There seems to be a focus on giving the feeling and illusion of space, even if factually, that isn&amp;rsquo;t true&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the actual app rewards ecosystem, let&amp;rsquo;s first take a bit of a detour into psychology and something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write about for quite some time: the concept of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place&#34;&gt;third place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short version is that in community building theory, there are concepts of &amp;ldquo;places&amp;rdquo;, with the &amp;ldquo;first place&amp;rdquo; being your home and the &amp;ldquo;second place&amp;rdquo; being your workplace. In his probably seminal&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4119.The_Great_Good_Place&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Great Good Place&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, Ray Oldenburg talks about the idea of a &amp;ldquo;third place&amp;rdquo;, which compliments the first and second, and aids in the feeling of having a connection to society and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I won&amp;rsquo;t go into it too much, nor am I particularly qualified to, there are a few key characteristics that you may or may not recognise in any number of places you go to such as coffee shops, libraries, bookstores, parks, churches and all sorts of non-work, communal settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A condensed version of those characteristics is roughly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It should be neutral&lt;/strong&gt;: No one is required to be there for any reason. You can come and go as you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status should not matter&lt;/strong&gt;: Whether you&amp;rsquo;re an executive or a retail assistant, you get the same treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The main activity is conversation&lt;/strong&gt;: Assuming you&amp;rsquo;re with friends or feel comfortable meeting strangers, the primary activity you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing is talking. Starbucks has a bit of an asterisk here as people also come to work in a solo capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There tend to be regulars&lt;/strong&gt;: The presence of regulars sets the tone and their presence also attracts newcomers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The location has a low profile&lt;/strong&gt;: It never feels intentionally pretentious or exclusive to any particular section of society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It has a light tone&lt;/strong&gt;: There&amp;rsquo;s never a sense of tension or extreme seriousness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It feels like a second home&lt;/strong&gt;: You feel like you belong, or perhaps more accurately, like you&amp;rsquo;re not unwanted given it is a business after all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&amp;rsquo;ve also forgotten what I was writing about in the first place but this is a long winded way of saying that I consider Starbucks to be a third place for some, whether they realise it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a teenager, nor do I really know what teenagers in the city do in their downtime, but it seems like young people definitely do come to places like this to hang out and so it seems to fit the criteria of a third place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For myself even, when I think of a place to come and work on my site, which is neither my job nor an aspect of my home, usually cafes with space tend to be a place to go. It started as a bit of a gag after seeing people with Macbooks in Starbucks but now I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people to some extent although I like to think without the pretentiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, but anyway, back to our main thread. Starbucks recently introduced their global &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.starbucks.co.nz/rewards&#34;&gt;rewards system&lt;/a&gt; to New Zealand. It&amp;rsquo;s a system where you have a virtual card and you can load it up with money. If you install one of the mobile apps, you can pull up your barcode on screen, scan it and collect rewards points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a good system, in that for Starbucks as a business, it establishes a sense of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out&#34;&gt;FOMO&lt;/a&gt;. If you don&amp;rsquo;t pay using the in-app virtual card, you can&amp;rsquo;t actually collect any points as I found out this morning. Given that, it allows Starbucks to compete for your attention outside of the bounds of its store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an element of lock-in, where you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother visiting other stores because the money you&amp;rsquo;ve already loaded onto your card is useless outside of it. That isn&amp;rsquo;t any different than other customer rewards system I&amp;rsquo;m sure, although you generally can&amp;rsquo;t pay for videogames or clothing in-store, via an app. At the risk of stating the obvious, there&amp;rsquo;s no particular reason for me to go to one store or another since there&amp;rsquo;s no differentiator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a double-lock in that while an asset is an asset, whether it&amp;rsquo;s $20 in cash or $20 on a transport card, having $20 on a Starbucks card feels like a waste of money if you have it sitting there and you go somewhere else for coffee. I don&amp;rsquo;t really think I get that feeling with transport because there aren&amp;rsquo;t really any reasonable alternatives. A bus can&amp;rsquo;t really compete with an Uber when it comes to speed but, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t particular care like myself, all coffee seems mostly interchangeable. I also wouldn&amp;rsquo;t come to Starbucks for coffee, if I cared about coffee that much I imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, I was going to make some comparisons to how this could evolve into a consumer hell if everyone starts to follow this model but the more I think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s not really a sensible forecasting of the future so I&amp;rsquo;m simply just not going to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also going to say that it&amp;rsquo;s a horrible rewards system compared to the original &amp;ldquo;Get 9 stamps and your 10th visit gets you a free coffee&amp;rdquo; but after doing the numbers ($1 = 2 points), $250 gets you to gold status. If you visit Starbucks frequently, that actually not too bad of a deal compared to something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uber.com/nz/en/u/rewards/&#34;&gt;Uber Rewards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I particularly achieved any meaningful insight with this whole thing other than &amp;ldquo;The third place is a thing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Some people probably feel that Starbucks is a third place&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if mobile app ecosystems make me feel better or worse about a third place&amp;rdquo; but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter since it&amp;rsquo;s a business and I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know or interact with anyone who works here in the first place&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably would be a third place if I came here with friends, but I don&amp;rsquo;t, so until then it&amp;rsquo;s just a convenient store that happens to have enough space to function as a work area (in which typing on my laptop is work) without the premium that comes with having to pay for a co-working space. The &amp;ldquo;co&amp;rdquo; part of co-working space is what I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly want anyway. It&amp;rsquo;s just nice being able to blend in and not having to feel like you should be networking or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it really is a third place then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of the idea of a &amp;ldquo;third place&amp;rdquo; for a few years now, I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually read any literature on it besides Wikipedia. In this case, it just seems nice to cite a source even though I&amp;rsquo;m writing this off the cuff. Something something professionalism.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pun intended&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
