      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I like to &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/nz-oia-guide/&#34;&gt;submit requests under the Official Information Act&lt;/a&gt; and see what fun datasets I can get my hands on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of these projects end up on the back burner and &lt;a href=&#34;https://towing.utf9k.net&#34;&gt;towing.utf9k.net&lt;/a&gt; was no different. Before we get too far, you might want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/projects/towing/&#34;&gt;read this brief overview&lt;/a&gt; about what it does to build some context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All up, it took me something like 4 or 5 years to finally consider it &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo;, in large part because I would hit a wall and not really be sure where to go from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With perfect 20/20 hindsight, such a project would be very quick to complete but for those starting out in the mapping space, taking a scenic walk through the creation process should hopefully serve as a nice jumping off point for how you might approach your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I kept all of my &amp;ldquo;workings&amp;rdquo; like as my cobbled together Python scripts and intermediate datasets, such that we can work through them from start to finish so you can have an idea of how this fun little visualisation was made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably worth noting that I&amp;rsquo;m not a data scientist by any means and a lot of steps could probably be made redundant if I knew better but it&amp;rsquo;s all a means to an end, and the end is pretty neat so I don&amp;rsquo;t really mind airing my dirty laundry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-inspiration&#34;&gt;Obtaining inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the hardest step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/projects/towing/&#34;&gt;brief project write up&lt;/a&gt;, the idea for a towing visualisation came to me when I was sitting at a cafe. I don&amp;rsquo;t imagine I would have come up with the idea any other way so it was basically a fluke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next best thing is seeing what other cool creations are floating around online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled on has come by way of &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise it at the time, but I think a few of my favourites that stick out have all come from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/foiachap&#34;&gt;Matt Chapman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mchap.io/using-foia-data-and-unix-to-halve-major-source-of-parking-tickets.html&#34;&gt;Using FOIA Data and Unix to halve major source of parking tickets&lt;/a&gt; was a particularly big inspiration on &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/projects/parnell/&#34;&gt;this smaller project of mine&lt;/a&gt; which ended up going in a different direction than what he had put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at it after all these years, and having a few pieces under my belt, I feel like there&amp;rsquo;s even more to improve in my own process so writing this post in itself has already been a big win for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, all this to say: As is usually the case, starting is often harder than any other part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the ball is rolling, you may hit some hard problems but I find it&amp;rsquo;s usually rare that they&amp;rsquo;re difficult in the sense of an immovable object. It&amp;rsquo;s more that it&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of work or figuring out the right terminology to use in a search query that will get you a step closer to the right tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s actually take a look at the project in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-our-dataset&#34;&gt;Obtaining our dataset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part varies depending on what type of data you&amp;rsquo;re looking for and depending on the country you&amp;rsquo;re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in New Zealand, we have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/nz-oia-guide/&#34;&gt;Official Information Act&lt;/a&gt; which defaults to everything being open unless there is a good reason for it not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, we have &lt;a href=&#34;https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset&#34;&gt;some pretty proactive agencies continuously publishing interesting datasets&lt;/a&gt; so not everything necessarily requires a formal request either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I was after data about vehicles that were towed in Auckland City which is not readily available, at least as far as I&amp;rsquo;m aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the correct authority can be a bit of a wild goose chase when you&amp;rsquo;re first starting out but most agencies should be pretty helpful in letting you know where the data you&amp;rsquo;re after might be held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I did a search for &lt;code&gt;auckland transport towing&lt;/code&gt; which surfaced &lt;a href=&#34;https://at.govt.nz/driving-parking/parking-rules/towing/&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; and I noticed an interesting mention near the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT contractors and private towing companies must notify police when they have towed a vehicle. They are required to provide the licence plate number and location they have moved the vehicle to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured contacting the New Zealand Police might be worth a shot in case they happened to hold more comprehensive information than Auckland Transport themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, they transferred my request to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.watercare.co.nz/Contact/Official-information-request&#34;&gt;LGOIMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Business Partner which I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have known was the right place, but most agencies are pretty good at redirecting you where you should go like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read &lt;a href=&#34;https://fyi.org.nz/request/11018-request-of-towing-data-for-three-tamaki-makaurau-police-districts&#34;&gt;the full correspondence&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea of how to structure a request, what some of the back and forth might look like, and to get a copy of the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our dataset on hand, let&amp;rsquo;s fire it up and take a look at what we&amp;rsquo;ve got to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-our-dataset-palatable&#34;&gt;Making our dataset palatable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening up &lt;code&gt;Marcus Aug 2016 Jul 2019.xlsx&lt;/code&gt; certainly leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;./spreadsheet.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of an Excel spreadsheet. There are many workbooks which each contain data for a specific year between 2016 and 2019. The data is formatted visually but will be a huge pain to access programmatically.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With just an initial glance, we can already spot a bunch of pain points with this data set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This dataset will be hard to query programmatically. In the &lt;code&gt;Date and Time&lt;/code&gt; column for instance, we have a mix of times and dates. If you were to take a random row, you would need to step back &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; number of rows to figure out the date and then apply that date to each row going forward, until you hit the next cell that resembles a date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addresses do not have much consistency.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some addresses include street numbers while others do not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of them contain suburbs so we may have address clashes with no way to know the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terms like &lt;code&gt;OPP&lt;/code&gt; in the case of &amp;ldquo;Opposite 55 Ngapuhi Road&amp;rdquo; which don&amp;rsquo;t tell us anything useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file column contains numbers that we need to map to something meaningful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least two visible entries have a vehicle starting from the same street they end up in
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps they were towed around the block or moved to unblock something? The data doesn&amp;rsquo;t say so we can only assume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first iteration of this project, I decided to ignore any information that would be hard to interpret so missing street numbers and the like were put to one side just to get things moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this step, I reached for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pandas.pydata.org/&#34;&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt; to create a hacky script that brute forced this dataset into something nice and easy to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is generally nice for these sorts of explorations, not only because it has a strong data science library but the lack of strong typing makes it easy to cludge together a project when your underlying data is a complete mess, structurally speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/tidying-towing-data/&#34;&gt;The entire process was detailed step by step&lt;/a&gt; on my blog a few years back. I had gotten as far as tidying the data but was a bit stumped on how to make anything usable out of it at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the impatient, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/main/auckland-towing/sheet_to_db.py&#34;&gt;this script&lt;/a&gt; is all you need to skim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s jump ahead to the end of that post which leaves us with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/index.html&#34;&gt;sqlite&lt;/a&gt; database called &lt;code&gt;towing.db&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geocoding---what-is-it&#34;&gt;Geocoding - what is it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we have a nice queryable list of addresses, they don&amp;rsquo;t actually mean anything to us in plain English. What we really want is a list of coordinates that we can plot on a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of taking an address and transforming it into a set of coordinates is known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_geocoding&#34;&gt;Address geocoding&lt;/a&gt;, or just &amp;ldquo;geocoding&amp;rdquo; for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we aren&amp;rsquo;t doing it in this project, it might be interesting to know that the reverse process of taking a set of coordinates and turning it into the nearest address is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system#Reverse_geocoding&#34;&gt;Reverse geocoding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do we go about geocoding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there are a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview&#34;&gt;geocoding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.here.com/documentation/geocoding-search-api/dev_guide/index.html&#34;&gt;providers&lt;/a&gt; that you could turn to but we have a pretty sizeable dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sqlite&#34; data-lang=&#34;sqlite&#34;&gt;sqlite&amp;gt; SELECT count(*) FROM events;
count(*) = 49174
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.here.com/get-started/pricing&#34;&gt;HERE Maps&lt;/a&gt; as an example, our dataset falls within the &lt;code&gt;30,001 to 5,000,000&lt;/code&gt; requests/month category giving us a cost of &lt;code&gt;0.830&lt;/code&gt; USD per 1000 requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll round it up to 50,000 to account for some API failures and network connectivity issues on our end and we&amp;rsquo;re looking at around $40 USD. Admittedly, that is a lot cheaper than I remember. Perhaps the prices have come down a lot since I last looked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Mapbox, it seems this would &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/#search&#34;&gt;even fall within their free tier&lt;/a&gt; so I would probably just go that route if I was starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing to consider is how many requests can you make before hitting a rate limit since you have to send every address across the wire, whether batched or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we&amp;rsquo;re going to do it all locally for free in exchange for a bit of elbow grease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geocoding---doing-it-in-practice&#34;&gt;Geocoding - Doing it in practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need a dataset that will translate addresses to coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in New Zealand, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linz.govt.nz/&#34;&gt;Land Information New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; provides this and many other datasets for free, by way of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linz.govt.nz/products-services/data/linz-data-service&#34;&gt;LINZ Data Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;./lds.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the LINZ Data Service, a web browser for viewing map layers and other types of data sets. In this image, the NZ Addresses dataset is selected and partly visible on the right side of the screen. On the left side is the LDS data set browser.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;rsquo;re looking at is one data point for each address in New Zealand that contains both the address broken into its component parts as well as the coordinates for that address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, we&amp;rsquo;ll download the dataset as a CSV and using &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/&#34;&gt;sqlite-utils&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://datasette.io/&#34;&gt;Datasette&lt;/a&gt; project, we can &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/main/auckland-towing/import_addresses.sh#L4&#34;&gt;insert the contents into our existing sqlite database&lt;/a&gt; which will let us perform joins between our two datasets down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick way to &amp;ldquo;geocode&amp;rdquo; is to just take all these addresses and then do a rough lookup to find an address that matches each one of our towing addresses. All that&amp;rsquo;s left is to check the associated coordinates if we get a match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, I would probably look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pelias/pelias&#34;&gt;Pelias&lt;/a&gt; as a middle ground although I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/765e97df94daa053f87970496d53ce9f50c21c39/auckland-towing/match-events-to-addresses.py&#34;&gt;a bit more data munging&lt;/a&gt;, we have a script that does exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to improve the odds of a match occurring, I added in some brute force checks to transform the most common abbreviations into their full names such as &lt;code&gt;st&lt;/code&gt; becoming &lt;code&gt;street&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process was quite lossy, as seen by the number of addresses that I wrote out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/765e97df94daa053f87970496d53ce9f50c21c39/auckland-towing/failures.txt&#34;&gt;a text file containing failed translations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the sheer number of originating data points, I didn&amp;rsquo;t worry about this too much since there&amp;rsquo;d be more than enough results to play with but it might be interesting to fix up a lot of the leftovers sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, our matching pair of addresses were &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/765e97df94daa053f87970496d53ce9f50c21c39/auckland-towing/trips.csv&#34;&gt;output to a CSV file&lt;/a&gt; for quick lookup in the next bit of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary but I figured that it would allow for quicker lookups iterating through a CSV file than having to perform joins between our two tables for every event. As with all things in this messy process, as long as it gets us to our final destination, doing it &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;translating-our-coordinates-into-routes&#34;&gt;Translating our coordinates into routes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now have a set of start and end coordinates that represent where a vehicle was towed from and where it ended up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good start but if we were to plot these on a map and then start simulating traffic between those two points, we would get something silly like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;./map-direct.png&#34; alt=&#34;A Mapbox map layer showing Newmarket, Auckland, New Zealand. There are two numbered points on opposite sides of the map with a line going straight from one to the other.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that cars don&amp;rsquo;t work this way in real life, just cutting through buildings and chunks of lands, so we somehow need to simulate the route that a vehicle is most likely to take so we have something more like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;./map-points.png&#34; alt=&#34;A Mapbox map layer showing Newmarket, Auckland, New Zealand. There are many numbered points, each at main intersections of the map with lines joining between them. It roughly follows the path that a car might drive.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how to generate routing data was a massive blocker for this project for a long time until I discovered the existence of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice&#34;&gt;openrouteservice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it&amp;rsquo;s a Java service that can be run locally in order to generate routing information. Better yet, it has a JSON API where you can submit coordinates and receive back structured routing information which is exactly what we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We specifically want the &lt;code&gt;/ors/v2/directions/driving-car&lt;/code&gt; endpoint to generate direction for a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to go even further, it might be interesting to gather average traffic data to simulate the speed to might take to drive down any given road but to make life easier, I just generated some fake timestamps that incremented by 2 seconds for each route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this is because the routes are actually very detailed, even more so than we need for our visualisation so we end up with a lot of navigation directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/765e97df94daa053f87970496d53ce9f50c21c39/auckland-towing/trips-to-vis.py&#34;&gt;we can put together another script&lt;/a&gt; that slowly iterates through our dataset and saves the resulting output into a file called &lt;code&gt;routes.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a bit of a weird format but don&amp;rsquo;t read too much into it. It&amp;rsquo;s just specific to the visualisation library that we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-together-our-visualisation&#34;&gt;Putting together our visualisation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a great deal of visualisation tools out there but one I had been meaning to try for some time is &lt;a href=&#34;https://deck.gl/&#34;&gt;deck.gl&lt;/a&gt;, a WebGL framework by Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly, I had come across their &lt;a href=&#34;https://deck.gl/examples/trips-layer&#34;&gt;TripsLayer demo&lt;/a&gt; some time back. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall but I probably saw the demo and thought it was exactly what I had in mind for how a representation of this towing data might look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the source code for all of the demo is available, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/tree/8.9-release/examples/website/trips&#34;&gt;including TripsLayer&lt;/a&gt;, so rather than reinvent the wheel, I took what was already released and restructured my dataset to fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did rip out some bits of the source code and made other tweaks but for the most part, the fundamentals didn&amp;rsquo;t change greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our &lt;code&gt;routes.json&lt;/code&gt; file generated in the last step, plugging the new data set in and spinning up the project gave us a nice, albeit a bit boring map to look out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our project was complete&amp;hellip; or was it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to the sheer number of data points in the graph, the visualisation was sluggish at best and near unusable on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from publishing the project and sharing it around with some colleagues but I was never quite happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward another year and I finally sat down to make some performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cutting-through-the-acres-of-data-points&#34;&gt;Cutting through the acres of data points&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a diagnosis to make other than &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s too much dang data&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than try anything fancy, I continued the theme of the brute force approach and took a machete to the dataset, slimming it down greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking from tradition, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/datasets/blob/765e97df94daa053f87970496d53ce9f50c21c39/auckland-towing/slim-down-routes.go&#34;&gt;wrote a quick program in Go&lt;/a&gt; because I felt that it would have a better change of succeeding in a reasonable time frame than something based in Python, not to mention we now had a well-structured dataset to make life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a high level, the script kept the first and last data points for each route taken and randomly deleted all of the points in between until just 10 were left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemed like it would break everything but it had the reverse effect. Not only did the performance greatly improve but the graph looked much cooler as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing this whole exercise exposed me to a lot of new mapping concepts such as geocoding, visualisation, route generation as well as some various tools for munging together data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say I&amp;rsquo;m glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t give up but more than anything, this project was an open loop in my mind that had finally beaten me, and that will usually always be enough to keep me coming back for more punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the coolest outcome is that because it&amp;rsquo;s visual, you can pop up a project like this on your phone and show people who might think it&amp;rsquo;s cool without necessarily having much background into what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably the one category of programming I do that&amp;rsquo;s closest to art in any sense which always helps to keep the perpetual motion machine running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wish it was easier to come by good ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hopefully you learned something useful reading this post and if you come across any better tools that I could have made use of earlier, please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to let me know at &lt;code&gt;hello@utf9k.net&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy mapping!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act can be thought of as an Official Information Act for local city councils. Sometimes, councils will try to get out of their obligations&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Here are some things that have been bothering me</description>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 19:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/i-dont-identify-as-anxious/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my &lt;a href=&#34;https://apenwarr.ca/log/20171213&#34;&gt;epic treatise&lt;/a&gt; on the things that have been troubling me for some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all of my most personal blog posts, you can expect this one to be at times flippant, absurd and other big words that I have to Google just to double check that I have the meaning correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I thought I had written something a bit closer to home, as far as mental health but it turns out that my &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/let-your-streaks-end-naturally&#34;&gt;previous attempts&lt;/a&gt; were much more abstract than I remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some level, I write this for myself with the naive thought that I can capture all these feelings in a bottle and discard them, not unlike a &lt;a href=&#34;https://oxsci.org/can-a-camera-capture-your-soul/&#34;&gt;camera stealing a soul&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll read this in future but really, I take some small comfort that perhaps this will be a useful barrier break for anyone who has a false idea of me in their head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever I may have been able to live up to so far, this is hopefully proof enough that &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo; by whatever means you define it is built on top of a great deal of well, whatever &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is, I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that should be enough of a pretentious introduction to shoo away anyone with a short attention span.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of late, I have had a handful of panic attacks. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I use that word lightly. The feeling is that my entire body goes nuclear hot, where I&amp;rsquo;m borderline sweating. I might be shaking physically and usually I end up vomiting just due to the amount of nervous shaking upsets my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really not very nice! It kinda sucks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has only happened a few times in the past 6 months or so which is actually very rare but there&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time, and today as I write this, I&amp;rsquo;ll catch myself remembering those feelings. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like a mind virus. You can ever so slightly remember the feeling and then you can start to imagine yourself feeling it again. You feel a light flush. Oh no, it&amp;rsquo;s back isn&amp;rsquo;t it? It was always coming back. It was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are things that aren&amp;rsquo;t true but the trick that I am still learning is to quieten those voices. I don&amp;rsquo;t even think telling them to go away is the right approach. They&amp;rsquo;re all valid things that are worth accepting while pushing back on the idea that they are set in stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would perhaps be easy to &amp;ldquo;think positive&amp;rdquo; but so much of this all feels like it&amp;rsquo;s subconscious as far as I can tell. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s not but I just can&amp;rsquo;t hear the voice that is causing all this. How can I &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; a battle when I can&amp;rsquo;t even see the battlefield or my opponent. Well, again for the me 2 paragraphs ago, it isn&amp;rsquo;t a battle is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These feelings are me and I am these feelings but I don&amp;rsquo;t have to lay down and let them run rampant. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to say that when you have a clear head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we should go over some specifics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m 28 as I write this and I assume part of this stems from anxiety about turning 30. Turning 30 itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t scare me but there are all these little things in my head that I think I associate with having &amp;ldquo;made it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already this is stupid. I have a good paying job and I&amp;rsquo;m (allegedly) respected at work. I have minimal to no debt and I can toot my horn about having gone the hard route of not getting a degree. What does making it even mean? I have very little to genuinely worry about each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my restricted drivers license (Stage 2 of 3) when I was about 16 but I put off my final test so I haven&amp;rsquo;t driven for like 12 years. Part of me probably feels like I need to resolve all this so I can be self sufficient and all that. Successful people drive don&amp;rsquo;tcha know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m single but I&amp;rsquo;ve always been happy with my own company. Haven&amp;rsquo;t I? We had a lot of good times right? I never thought I minded but all of a sudden, it can get awfully lonely when you&amp;rsquo;re going through all this. It&amp;rsquo;s scary to live alone and you freak out at night. There&amp;rsquo;s no one around to talk to. Minutes can feel like hours and hours like weeks. Sleeping it all off would be a wonder except your body is primed to the brim with adrenaline so cross that off the list. I got a little teary writing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only imagine that these things are all in there somewhere contributing to this troubling period. You&amp;rsquo;ll be great and things are normal but suddenly you remember that you remember that you remember and it&amp;rsquo;s the darkest few hours of your waking existence. Why is this happening again? If I can just find the answer, will it leave me alone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest answer, when I think over all the things that frighten me, is that I have to do all of this &lt;em&gt;waves hands&lt;/em&gt; for the next 70 years or more. I think that only to rebut myself in the same sentence with &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s so bad about that? There are so many things to see and do!&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s the feeling of dread persisting at its core, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not an anxious person? I don&amp;rsquo;t identify as such but factually, that might be correct? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, is it anxiety? It&amp;rsquo;s irrational for sure. It&amp;rsquo;s like I&amp;rsquo;m scared that I&amp;rsquo;m scared and I don&amp;rsquo;t know where it starts and ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d tackle it normally. I had some more severe bouts that were exponentially worse back when I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/ride-the-curve&#34;&gt;Ride the Curve&lt;/a&gt;. By all accounts, I&amp;rsquo;ve almost won, right? The symptoms are a whisper of what they were and the distance between them is ever shorter but when it pops up, I just want to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll ask my doctor if I can go back to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escitalopram&#34;&gt;what helped break me out last time&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t take any pride in fighting mental illness on hard mode. I don&amp;rsquo;t wish it on anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno, I&amp;rsquo;ll go about my day and things are great. Great is a strong word. Things are fine. Maybe I need more novelty in my life. It&amp;rsquo;s the remmebering that this whole ordeal exists that opens the door ever so slightly for doubt to creep in. It could happen again so why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been even stronger in reassuring myself that there are so many possibilities and that it&amp;rsquo;s just my brain playing tricks but it&amp;rsquo;s exhausting. Trying to self-monitor your own thoughts is exhausting. Your brain is effectively playing dual roles where you&amp;rsquo;re watching yourself in third person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing this has made me go up and down a bit where I&amp;rsquo;m a little jittery but who knows, that could just be the cold that&amp;rsquo;s creeping in and I&amp;rsquo;m unintentionally feeding the nuclear fire with all these inputs that are unrelated. While things are quiet, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll go to bed early. Napping is great. I wish I had more time this afternoon but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to risk staying up. A thought creeped in that today was going to be one of the very bad ones. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope it isn&amp;rsquo;t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read this far, I appreciate the effort. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine in the long run. While all these emotions were fresh, I wanted to capture them down since they&amp;rsquo;re hard to explain. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know if any of this makes sense since I write these sorts of posts off the cuff with no editing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Miserable presentation tips</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/miserable-presentation-tips/</link>
      <description>It works well for me but I don&#39;t recommend it!</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 15:24:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/miserable-presentation-tips/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When the thought of having to give a presentation comes up, my usual reaction is that it might be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve given a decent handful of talks over the last few years to medium-ish audiences, with the largest being to around 100 people. For various reasons, the most recent ones have been via video calls but I&amp;rsquo;ve done a couple in person and they don&amp;rsquo;t feel that different in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I could start to hock my self help book&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and say &amp;ldquo;Imagine the audience in their underwear&amp;rdquo; but instead, why not dump out my brain on paper so that you too, for the low low price of $0, can also think about presentations upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My general threshold for being &amp;ldquo;comfortable&amp;rdquo; with giving a talk is about 10 or more people, where I&amp;rsquo;m kinda awful when it comes to groups greater than 1 person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why that is, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to imagine in a group of a few people, you stand out a lot more if you aren&amp;rsquo;t say much (or are saying a lot!) with the best way to &amp;ldquo;hide&amp;rdquo; being to act normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t the same apply for a group where you&amp;rsquo;re centre stage? It does I&amp;rsquo;m sure but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to imagine the group as a whole not paying attention to what you&amp;rsquo;re saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a safe bet that it&amp;rsquo;s a reflection of my time in school, doing English class speeches where students, myself included, would zone out while someone had to give their presentation, even if it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like it to the presenter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I should be overly clear here and say that this line of thought should not be taken seriously! It can be a useful tool but if you start to genuinely believe no one cares, that becomes dangerous the further you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that no one would turn up if they weren&amp;rsquo;t interested, or wanting to support your output and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, I put it in the same category as receiving complements where my initial reaction is to downplay them, partly out of embarrassment from receiving attention and partly because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen regularly meaning it&amp;rsquo;s not normalised for me. Feeling that way doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it any less accurate or make you any less deserving of it however!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our fantasy worldview where we falsely believe no one is paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I always try to make sure the talk I&amp;rsquo;m giving is something I would find interesting myself. In this view of things, I&amp;rsquo;m the only one hearing myself talk which means I want to make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t get bored of what I have to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put another way, I try to give a talk that my past self would enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going a step further, you might even imagine that the talk itself is besides the point. It&amp;rsquo;s an artefact that you&amp;rsquo;ll be discarding, with the fun part being the research process. It&amp;rsquo;s like free motivation to look into something that you otherwise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have found interesting.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main underlying idea is to expect nothing with any response being a positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get a positive response, then great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get a neutral response, you didn&amp;rsquo;t lose (or gain) anything and likely learned a bunch on top of +5 Presentation EXP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a negative response is unlikely given the vast majority of people don&amp;rsquo;t like confrontation. In the rare event it does happen, it sounds like you made something that compelled someone to have an opinion which is a strange win if you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should all be taken with a large pinch of salt (and therapy?) but used in the right way, it can be a handy story to tell yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merely saying &amp;quot;	Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it&amp;quot; is easy but getting to a place where you can believe it, even for a short while is the hardest part of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t read enough self-help books yet to have the motivation to write a self-help book 😛&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m assuming here that you&amp;rsquo;ve volunteered to give a presentation instead of a boring business thing.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Habit forming in the least efficient way possible</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/inefficient-habit-forming/</link>
      <description>Instead of committing to a habit, why not torture yourself over long spans of time?</description>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 18:30:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/inefficient-habit-forming/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you were to ask me how good I am at habit forming, I would say &amp;ldquo;Not very&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back over time, there are plenty of routines that I do at present but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call them formed habits since they still take some thinking (and remembering) that I should have done them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say &amp;ldquo;Well, just put them in your task manager&amp;rdquo; and that is a very good idea except that would assume that I have successfully formed a habit of checking my task manager religiously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably more accurate to say that my worse habits are much stronger and end up eating up the attention I should/would/could be dedicating to things that aren&amp;rsquo;t, I dunno, clearing out Slack notifications or opening Hacker News for the nth time today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now believe it or not, I&amp;rsquo;m actually here to some good things that might give a little hope to my fellow habit-forming dropouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various habits that I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/itjmKlYjUak&#34;&gt;restarted over and over again&lt;/a&gt;, usually with extremely long gaps between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example might be cleaning my apartment. I should do it daily but historically I might go for quite some time before I get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days I&amp;rsquo;m down to like once a week or less which is really good and something I probably thought wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible but I also never committed to cleaning as some sort of core part of my identity that I&amp;rsquo;m highly focused on reinforcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the point here is even if you repeat the same routine over and over, with extremely large gaps between each iteration, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably find that without realising, the feedback loop gets every so slightly shorter, even if it&amp;rsquo;s over the period of literal years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t to say you should try to form any habits this way but even if you fret over not picking up a habit you committed to, the act of fretting itself is still reinforcing the habit in some very meandering way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So you have (or are) competition</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/so-you-have-or-are-competition/</link>
      <description>A series of questions that I would ask my past self in certain awkward situations</description>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 22:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/so-you-have-or-are-competition/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;div class=&#34;notice&#34;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;🧪&lt;/span&gt;This post is a sort of weird living document of sorts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I got kind of lazy towards the end so I&amp;rsquo;m pushing out what I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I also intend to add to the list of bullet points as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of post that is harder to capture the further away you are from the situation in question!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally on this site I have two types of posts: Relatively straight forward technical posts and long-winded, more experimental posts that I would just link to myself in the past if time travel existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is heavily one of the latter and it revolved around a certain type of unintentional competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s targeted at an awkward gap at which I, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of us, have fallen into from time to time which I&amp;rsquo;ll define in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, these are scenarios I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered in a work setting but I suppose they could apply just as equally in any sort of community from friend groups to event committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep this whole thing general enough so as to leave it open for your own intepretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll probably also make this a &amp;ldquo;living document&amp;rdquo; that I add things to as I think of them. It&amp;rsquo;ll be pretty messy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-twin-scenarios&#34;&gt;The twin scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;a) You have just created and launched something into the wild, only to find that someone else in your area is already invested in that problem domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Someone else has just created and launched something into the wild, which you have just discovered and you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure how to feel about it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two scenarios are the same scenario, just from different angles. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve both caused Scenario A and felt the effects of Scenario B. I&amp;rsquo;ve even experienced both A and B for the same problem domain within the same year, which felt a bit like karma funnily enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scenarios happen all the time for everything I&amp;rsquo;m sure and neither side can feel pleasant. Emotions get heated, people get protective of &amp;ldquo;their&amp;rdquo; domains that they&amp;rsquo;ve invested time into and things can turn a bit sour if they&amp;rsquo;re not evaluated properly with some perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all things emotional, you should step back and think about the bigger picture!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in that narrow period of time, or just want some tips for next time on how you might deal with it then here are some thoughts you might want to mull over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just going to throw out bullet points because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) It&amp;rsquo;s quicker and I&amp;rsquo;m being lazy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) I can&amp;rsquo;t give you the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s never an open and shut case, as much as you might want to cite time investment, experience, job titles and all sorts of other things you can reach for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best answer is the one that sucks and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t arrived at a good time but there&amp;rsquo;s never really a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and one last thing: When you invest time and effort into something, it&amp;rsquo;s natural to feel emotional! You can&amp;rsquo;t unlogic yourself out of those feelings and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not up for the task, don&amp;rsquo;t read these points and beat yourself up by any means. That&amp;rsquo;s not what this is for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just things to ask yourself in a neutral light. Don&amp;rsquo;t judge yourself for actions that have already passed. It&amp;rsquo;s more about deciding what to do next and what you might do differently next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-experiencing-scenario-a&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing Scenario A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve just created something and you&amp;rsquo;ve been informed that your idea already exists in some other form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How was the reaction that you received?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was it welcoming to a newcomer into that space?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no, that&amp;rsquo;s not very nice
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is that? Does this happen a lot?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, that sounds like a them problem right? Something keeps going wrong that people arrive at the conclusion that they need to start from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-experiencing-b&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing B&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve have or are actively creating something and you&amp;rsquo;ve been informed that someone has just stepped into your problem domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are you feeling about this news right now?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you excited for some new competition, regardless of whether you agree with the approach?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, great, that sounds healthy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no, why is that?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you feel that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t compare in terms of quality to your work?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, why does that matter?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does a new offering existing somehow take away from your work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your work able to stand on its own merits?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no, should it exist if it can&amp;rsquo;t support itself and needs ie; political cover to stay alive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you feel that people don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate it fully?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have solid documentation and announcements that people can discover on their own time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your approach communicated clearly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the problem space too deep in the weeds for people who are not domain experts to &amp;ldquo;get it&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you considered making use of metaphors, or just general storytelling to help bridge the communication gap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has enough time actually passed for people to &amp;ldquo;have time&amp;rdquo; to learn about your offering and to &amp;ldquo;get it&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you actually talked to anyone about your problem area?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you know that this problem area is actually a problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do other people see this problem area as being a problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do other people have this problem enough to &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; that it is a problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the length of the problem only felt in short enough bursts that others are not motivated enough to seek out a solution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you feel an emotion reaction to this news?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, why is that?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you consider yourself to be an expert in this particular domain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you spend a lot of time working in this particular domain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this particular domain just one that you spend time in or your core one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you felt an overwhelming emotion reaction, is your identity and sense of self worth tied into this domain?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should it be? Maybe it is more than you realise?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you feel that you could walk away from this problem domain and not feel a great loss?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you need to diversity your identity a bit more and find some different hobbies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>In which we take a brief tour in all the ways that metrics may not accurately capture reality</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 19:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/sampling-all-the-way-down/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was chatting with a coworker about the accuracy of tracing. In particular, we were discussing &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/&#34;&gt;Datadog APM&lt;/a&gt; but the same discussion probably applies equally to &lt;a href=&#34;https://opentelemetry.io/&#34;&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; as well as other SaaS provider implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, when I say accuracy here, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the accuracy of what each trace is presenting. The overall picture is more than accurate enough but I would argue that it will never 100% reflect reality, nor is that necessarily something valuable to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it might be interesting, both for my own future reference but also just as a general discussion to go through some of the various ways that tracing may not reflect reality in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://datadog-docs.imgix.net/images/tracing/apm_lifecycle/apm_lifecycle_0.c5017c20b222d73a29b5a1a223f83eb4.png?auto=format&#34; alt=&#34;A diagram showing various parts of the Datadog ingestion pipeline. The screenshot is just meant to reflect the sprawl of different bits involved in the pipeline. The actual elements of the pipeline itself aren&amp;amp;rsquo;t so important for this image.&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-outer-wall&#34;&gt;The outer wall&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, there are surely some portion of requests that will never reach your servers in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably not a lot in accurate but you might imagine various scenarios like someone attempting to visit your website only for their ISP&amp;rsquo;s DNS server to throw a fit, or someone browsing on a train only for their connection to get temporarily blackholed as they pass through a concrete tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These requests won&amp;rsquo;t even reach you so they won&amp;rsquo;t even show up in your tracing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;application-sampling&#34;&gt;Application sampling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;apps.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A version of the Datadog ingestion pipeline, with a section titled Your instrumented apps being selected. It reflects the part of the pipeline we are going to discuss in this section.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;rsquo;ve got requests hitting our application so we capture 100% of those requests as traces and life is easy right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only it were so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, your service will save &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_pipeline/ingestion_mechanisms/?tab=go#in-tracing-libraries-user-defined-rules&#34;&gt;100 traces per second&lt;/a&gt; unless you explicitly set an override.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datadog does recommend setting a sample rate of 100%, as you&amp;rsquo;re only charged for traces indexed and retained beyond the initial 15 minute ingestion window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also have cases where code within your application could be &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_pipeline/ingestion_mechanisms/?tab=go#force-keep-and-drop&#34;&gt;explicitly causing traces to be discarded&lt;/a&gt; if they&amp;rsquo;re not useful. The inverse is true with retaining specific traces as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above also assumes that your application is configured properly as well to ensure those traces aren&amp;rsquo;t being emitted into a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agent-sampling&#34;&gt;Agent sampling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;apps.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The same Datadog ingestion pipeline shown in the previous image with no changes.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we go a level high to the process that receives all of your traces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has its &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_pipeline/ingestion_mechanisms/?tab=go#in-the-agent&#34;&gt;own sampling&lt;/a&gt; which will only retain ~10 traces/second per agent instance. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that this is overridden by setting your application sample rate explicitly but if you haven&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing a portion of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also get rate limited, causing traces to probably be discarded, if you have &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/pkg/config/config_template.yaml#L1152&#34;&gt;too many services connecting to a single agent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/pkg/config/config_template.yaml#L1082&#34;&gt;your agent is using too much memory&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/pkg/config/config_template.yaml#L1091&#34;&gt;your agent is using too much CPU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://datadog-docs.imgix.net/images/tracing/trace_indexing_and_ingestion/service_traffic_breakdown.a0e421f3503064b7d03f1c3683a67fc4.png?auto=format&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Datadog service ingestion screen showing a service that has &amp;amp;lt;0.1% of traces sampled due to agent CPU or RAM usage&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of all this, there&amp;rsquo;s further sampling beyond the &amp;ldquo;10 traces/second&amp;rdquo; which is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/troubleshooting/agent_rate_limits/#maximum-events-per-second-limit&#34;&gt;max of 200 trace events per second&lt;/a&gt;. What is a trace event versus a trace you ask? I have no idea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should probably also disable the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/pkg/config/config_template.yaml#L1068&#34;&gt;error sampler&lt;/a&gt; so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact your picture of reality too for maximum accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, this too assumes that all of your agent instances are properly configured and aren&amp;rsquo;t dropping traces off a cliff or else you&amp;rsquo;ll be missing a portion of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ingestion-sampling&#34;&gt;Ingestion Sampling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://datadog-docs.imgix.net/images/tracing/apm_lifecycle/ingestion_sampling_rules.664739c275df2d563b782552d467422e.png?auto=format&#34; alt=&#34;A version of the Datadog ingestion pipeline, with a section titled Ingestion sampling rules being selected. It reflects the part of the pipeline we are going to discuss in this section.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, you thought we were done? We&amp;rsquo;re just getting started because we&amp;rsquo;ve got more things to toggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve configured your application and agent perfectly but you&amp;rsquo;re still not perfectly reflecting reality. &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_pipeline/ingestion_controls/#service-ingestion-summary&#34;&gt;Did you know upstream services can decide whether traces involving your service are discarded or retained?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://datadog-docs.imgix.net/images/tracing/trace_indexing_and_ingestion/service_ingestion_summary.fd43c5c59b2c9273cd84e8467b958194.png?auto=format&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Service Ingestion Summary screen showing a service. Visible to the right side are all of the upstream services that have influence on the displayed services trace sampling decisions.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should probably go talk to your coworkers who maintain upstream services and argue the case for never sampling a single trace. Depending on who controls the credit card, it may not be quite as compelling when considering the huge bill that may be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;retention-filters&#34;&gt;Retention Filters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://datadog-docs.imgix.net/images/tracing/apm_lifecycle/retention_filters.5e6f2b4eedbe790caf41a7e090048deb.png?auto=format&#34; alt=&#34;A version of the Datadog ingestion pipeline, with a section titled Retention filters being selected. It reflects the part of the pipeline we are going to discuss in this section.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, we&amp;rsquo;re nearly through the gauntlet because all we&amp;rsquo;ve got left are retention filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s say that your application sends 100% of traces to Datadog and never gets sampled along the way. That just means your traces are 100% visible for a mere 15 minutes before more sampling kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retention filters are the final boss here, where by default, Datadog maintains all errors (across a diverse range of errors codes) and a handful of successful traces based on their latencies, status codes and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you could simply mark all traces as being retained beyond that 15 minute window but I hope you&amp;rsquo;re ready to re-mortgage your house to afford it because indexing ain&amp;rsquo;t cheap, beyond the defaults chosen by Datadog themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also need to ensure that no one else has set up any retention filters that might sample your application in any way so fire up those access control policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you&amp;rsquo;re a rich lister however, you&amp;rsquo;ve made it to the end&amp;hellip; right? All is right with the world and we have a perfectly perfect view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-secret-hidden-boss&#34;&gt;The Secret Hidden Boss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you have every single trace ever generated, perfection is still out of reach because the insights into our traces themselves may be skewed, short of our combing through all of the data outselves which is likely not possible at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand more, we need to briefly talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10693.pdf&#34;&gt;DDSketch&lt;/a&gt; which is Datadog&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;sketching&amp;rdquo; algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard of the term before but just as a sketch in drawing is an approximation of a fleshed out drawing, a sketch in computer science is an approximation of some set of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sketch is not a full accurate set of all existing data points but as an approximation, we can infer things that are roughly true about the source data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say our true data set contains 1 million values and the data set is effectively a random sampling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take a sample of 1000 values from our source data set and in most cases, the median value within our sample is likely to be about the same as it is in our source data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may not be 100% precise, depending on our use case, it&amp;rsquo;s probably good enough without the overhead of having to process the full dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work however is with quantiles, or percentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say we wanted to find the maximum value in our 1 million data points. You could just iterate through all of them and keep track of the highest value you&amp;rsquo;ve seen. There&amp;rsquo;s no need to keep every data point in memory, just the current value you&amp;rsquo;re looking at and the highest value you&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about finding the 99% percentile? Well, we need to retain all of the values we&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far in order to continually compare values we&amp;rsquo;re seeing against our 1% grouping and further comparing that to our full dataset to ensure that we&amp;rsquo;re adding and removing the right values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a thing would get quite expensive which is where sketching comes in and it&amp;rsquo;s what Datadog does to your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than perfectly calculating percentiles down to the very last decimal place, traces can be &amp;ldquo;bucketed&amp;rdquo; into rounded that are near enough to capture what they represent but we only need to store the bucket values and not every single value that is allocated to a bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/engineering/computing-accurate-percentiles-with-ddsketch/ddsketch_diagram_6_190911.png?auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=847&amp;amp;dpr=2&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot showing latency buckets. There are three labelled 100 milliseconds, 102 milliseconds and 104 milliseconds. Traces that a few decimal places outside of each bucket are sampled into their closest buckets. For example, a trace that took 104.4 milliseconds is sampled into the 104 millisecond bucket.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is effectively the sketch in question and you can read more about the entire process &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/computing-accurate-percentiles-with-ddsketch/&#34;&gt;in this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, even if you did manage to capture all traces, the insights you&amp;rsquo;re getting from them have likely been skewed from reality ever so slightly through the sketching process so you&amp;rsquo;ll never win unless you handle each trace yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-doesnt-matter-in-the-end&#34;&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter in the end&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than anything, this post is partly a technical guide but mostly fun exercise with the end of goal of saying &amp;ldquo;Who cares&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the short story &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Exactitude_in_Science&#34;&gt;On Exactitude in Science&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a short story about a kingdom who become so good at map making that they make the most accurate map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that it&amp;rsquo;s 1:1 scale with the kingdom itself in order to capture it in perfect detail. Such a map may be precise but it&amp;rsquo;s so detailed and unwieldy as to be useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big advocate of the same idea in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly so I can be lazy but also because beyond a certain point, true accuracy doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you want is just enough detail to know that things are happening but further detail is just diminshing returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you want to reflect rate limits for a particular customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it really matter whether they&amp;rsquo;re being rate limited 5 times per day or 1000 times per day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond a certain point, the damage is already done and they&amp;rsquo;re having a bad time so knowing the true extent doesn&amp;rsquo;t really change the facts of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be interesting to know for sure and you might want to know but there is probably no such thing as a truly accurate value, whether it&amp;rsquo;s tracing, logs or something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re probably better off just getting something good enough and then having a nap or investing that time into other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do demo iPads have a canonical owner?</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/ipad-canonical-owner/</link>
      <description>In which we investigate whether the demo content loaded onto iPads is owned a single fictional person</description>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 23:35:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/ipad-canonical-owner/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I ordered a 4th generation Apple iPad Air and the store I purchased it from accidentally sent me a demo unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fully working iPad but it came preloaded with a number of dummy items such as a five calendars, a handful of documents and acres of photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see these in any store but generally, you never get a chance to spend any length of time with them so making the most of this opportunity, I took a full backup of the device before resetting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;storedisplay.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A photo of an iPad Pro set up for display inside of a Noel Leeming store. Visible on the iPad is the Photos app set to the time period spanning 17 - 25th July 2019&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, the store got in contact with me and requested that I return it back to them since it wasn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be dispatched. They didn&amp;rsquo;t have any other units on hand so I ended up getting a refund instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I figured it might be of some interest to someone so I &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/i-pad-demo-backup&#34;&gt;uploaded a copy of the demo materials to the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; and never got around to doing anything more until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I had wondered was if any of the content in the device was actually intertwined or if it was just a random helping of documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is that it is mostly just random items but each category of item tends to have been created from the point of view of a single person which is kind of neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a brief rundown of what I found and what I could infer from the demo content about each fictional person as best as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the data is meaningless outside of the demo unit such as Photos which were grouped such as two images that were under the &amp;ldquo;Selfies&amp;rdquo; category but I can&amp;rsquo;t recreate that information with the photos themselves so this post can&amp;rsquo;t be as extensive as it could have been but ah well, I mainly want to get this post off of my project backlog once and for all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;calendars&#34;&gt;Calendars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll start with the juiciest of all the categories first since the rest are fairly light on detail. We can infer quite a bit from the calendar from the various locations attached to events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;calendar.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;amp;rsquo;s computer. 11 events are visible across five different calendars.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loaded onto the demo unit were 5 calendars which are available as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar&#34;&gt;ICS&lt;/a&gt; exports for browsing with any Calendar client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the calendar events consist entirely of recurring events which makes sense for a demo unit which may sit around for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five calendars available are called &lt;code&gt;Kids&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Personal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Recreation&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Training&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Work&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll mention in advance that a number of locations are mentioned in the calendar entries which are mostly real places around California so I dig into those a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll work through them in order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;kids&#34;&gt;Kids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;kids.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;amp;rsquo;s computer. The Kids calendar is selected.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only 3 events on the kids calendar which are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adam&amp;rsquo;s Piano lesson from 3:30pm - 4:30pm every Tuesday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ellie&amp;rsquo;s Soccer Game from 6:00pm - 8:00pm every Wednesday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adam&amp;rsquo;s Soccer Game from 11:00am - 2:00pm on every 5th Saturday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can infer that this person has two kids: Adam and Ellie. Both play Soccer and Adam plays the piano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description for &lt;code&gt;Ellie&#39;s Soccer Game&lt;/code&gt; mentioned &lt;code&gt;At Mount Tiburon High School - back field on the left.&lt;/code&gt; in the description for the event but as far as I can tell, there isn&amp;rsquo;t a Mount Tiburon High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiburon,_California&#34;&gt;Tiburon&lt;/a&gt; is a real town in California that has a Mount Tiburon Road but no high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Tiburon is apparently home to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiburon,_California#Schools&#34;&gt;St. Hilary School&lt;/a&gt; which is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/nz/education/k12/apple-distinguished-schools/&#34;&gt;Apple Distinguished School&lt;/a&gt; but it&amp;rsquo;s probably a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;personal&#34;&gt;Personal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;personal.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;amp;rsquo;s computer. The Personal calendar is selected.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This calendar is home to a few generic events such as &amp;ldquo;Pay Bills&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Doctor&amp;rsquo;s Appointment&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of lunch and coffee catchups and they tend to be at real places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lunch with Pablo at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.michaelmina.net/restaurants/&#34;&gt;Michael Mina&lt;/a&gt; every 2 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lunch with Becky at &lt;a href=&#34;https://yanksing.com/&#34;&gt;Yank Sing&lt;/a&gt; every 7 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lunch with Mum at &lt;a href=&#34;https://hoodline.com/2017/09/french-bistro-south-park-cafe-to-bid-adieu/&#34;&gt;Bistro - South Park&lt;/a&gt; every 4 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other catchups but none of them feature any locations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;recreation&#34;&gt;Recreation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;recreation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;amp;rsquo;s computer. The Recreation calendar is selected.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This calendar is what it says on the tin and features a number of locations as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lunch with Lucy at &lt;a href=&#34;https://yanksing.com/&#34;&gt;Yank Sing&lt;/a&gt; every 3 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bowling at Biltmore Lanes every month.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any information on Biltmore Lanes if that&amp;rsquo;s a real place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neighbourhood Council at Community Centre on the 4th month of every Sunday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The community centre in question is not named but perhaps you could triangulate one by cross-referencing the locations the calendar owner visits?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yoga at &lt;a href=&#34;https://2ndstreetgym.com/&#34;&gt;2nd Street Gym&lt;/a&gt; every 3 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brunch with Mindy at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zaziesf.com/&#34;&gt;Zazie&lt;/a&gt; on the 1st Sunday of every month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tennis with Katy at the 4th Street Courts every 3 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;training&#34;&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;training.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;amp;rsquo;s computer. The Training calendar is selected.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expected this calendar to be full of gym sessions but instead it&amp;rsquo;s a work calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who the training is in reference to, or if this calendar is even accurately named since it seems like a bunch of business meetings more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design Team Staff Meeting: &amp;ldquo;To review designs for this week&amp;rsquo;s exec meetng and discuss remaining designs needed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Graphic Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Presentation with Susan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project Planning Meeting: &amp;ldquo;To discuss project plan and review milestones and deliverables&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this appears to be training unless it&amp;rsquo;s training for design team members perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, we can infer that this person is perhaps some sort of product manager?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;work&#34;&gt;Work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;work.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;amp;rsquo;s computer. The Work calendar is selected.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is definitely the fullest calendar with a number of business meetings and catchups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly Team Meeting: &amp;ldquo;To discuss project status and deliverables. Please bring status on each deliverable due this week.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference Call with Exec Team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budget Review: &amp;ldquo;To review budget plans for upcoming projects&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design Review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contract Review with Allison&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Executive Briefing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expense Review: &amp;ldquo;To review this expenses to date and discuss plans for the next phase of the project.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting with Sales Team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all very generic as to what this person&amp;rsquo;s role is but of course, this is all stuff designed to be glanced at for a couple of seconds if at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a monthly entry for &amp;ldquo;Pancake Breakfast&amp;rdquo; at &amp;ldquo;St. Mary&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any such place in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area&#34;&gt;Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;contacts&#34;&gt;Contacts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 238 contact entries provided in two formats: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard&#34;&gt;VCF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://fileinfo.com/extension/abbu&#34;&gt;ABBU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;contacts.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Contacts app visible on the author&amp;amp;rsquo;s computer. A contact entry for Shota Aoyagi is selected. They have an iCloud email and allegedly live in Rochester, New York. Their contact card has a stock photo.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of contacts have addressed all across the United States of America with a handful that have addresses in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given I live in New Zealand, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that demo units have a handful of regionalised entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t determine any link between the contact entries and other categories ie; no one from the Contacts list appears in any of the Calendar entries or in the Summer Garden Party attendee list that we&amp;rsquo;ll be covering later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I did google a number of the names and they all appear to be Apple employees in some capacity but with stock avatars and made up contact details of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were loaded as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)&#34;&gt;Apple Notes&lt;/a&gt; but there&amp;rsquo;s no standard format so they were all exported as PDFs. They&amp;rsquo;re mostly intact but some formatting got mangled in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;notes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Preview app showing a PDF. The PDF is an exported Apple Note showing a sketch for a treehouse. The note is titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Jake&amp;amp;rsquo;s treehouse!!&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a note for &lt;code&gt;After-school activities for Jake&lt;/code&gt; containing a checklist of sports so presumably this person is helping their son to decide on a sport. Interestingly, one of the entries is &amp;ldquo;Footy&amp;rdquo; which is a slang term for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_rules_football&#34;&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; so I guess this note is localised a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems this person is building a back porch based on the &lt;code&gt;Back porch dimensions&lt;/code&gt; note with another title &lt;code&gt;Garden proposal from our architect&lt;/code&gt; which details where to lay out plants around their &amp;ldquo;back patio&amp;rdquo;. I would note that porch isn&amp;rsquo;t really a term used in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania&#34;&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping with the renovation theme, we also have notes for &lt;code&gt;Trees/Plants for front garden&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Things to do for salsa garden&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;New dishwasher options&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Living room remodel ideas&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Kitchen&lt;/code&gt; (renovation) and &lt;code&gt;Get at hardware store&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I noted before about the mention of &amp;ldquo;Footy&amp;rdquo;, there are a few holiday planning notes that are all in America. The note &lt;code&gt;Ideas for US reunion w/ Dave and crew&lt;/code&gt; has an entry for New York City that reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all met here and we all love this city, but maybe not the best choice for a week of catching up over old times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the term &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; implies that the person writing these notes currently lives in New York City but a few notes contradict this idea because they feature measurements in centimetres. America is one of the few countries that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units&#34;&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t make use of the metric system&lt;/a&gt; so this doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few holiday notes seem to center around California which definitely lines up with the general Apple-adjacent locations that appear through the demo unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note titled &lt;code&gt;Soccer practise times&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; contains practice times for Zoe and Ella who, in addition to Jake, are presumably the three children of the author of these notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice times mentioned take place at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.santaritaschool.org/santaritaes/6993-Address-Directions.html&#34;&gt;Santa Rita School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.covingtonschool.org/ces/4740-About.html&#34;&gt;Covington School&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.losaltosca.gov/recreation/page/rosita-park&#34;&gt;Rosita Park&lt;/a&gt; which are all real places in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.losaltosca.gov/&#34;&gt;Los Altos, California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you check on a map, Los Altos is a short drive from Cupertino, which is home to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park&#34;&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s donut headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the above, most of the notes don&amp;rsquo;t really tell us much about the author besides the fact that they have three kids it appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;numbers&#34;&gt;Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a planning spreadsheet for a Summer Garden Party available as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(spreadsheet)&#34;&gt;Numbers&lt;/a&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;numbers.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Preview app displaying a preview of a Number spreadsheet. Visible is a planning document for a garden party which lists a number of hosts and guests. A number of tasks are planned to be done between June and July. There are 4 sheets in total.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much to say about this other than it&amp;rsquo;s a planning document for a party. I cross-referenced the names with the Contacts entries and while there were some shared names, I don&amp;rsquo;t think they were the same people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I was able to infer was from a section on the &amp;ldquo;Budget&amp;rdquo; sheet titled &amp;ldquo;Useful Contacts&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lists a number of party-related businesses such as &amp;ldquo;Joe the Juggler&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;True Cook&amp;rdquo; catering. All of the phone numbers feature area codes from around the New York area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pages&#34;&gt;Pages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a document on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa&#34;&gt;Leaning Tower of Pisa&lt;/a&gt; created with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pages_(word_processor)&#34;&gt;Pages&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s available as a &lt;code&gt;.pages&lt;/code&gt; file as well as a PDF export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;pages.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Preview app displaying a preview of a Pages document. Visible is a page about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It talks about the history of the tower and how it wasn&amp;amp;rsquo;t always leaning.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears to be a school report since it&amp;rsquo;s relatively accessible and light on details. The cover page says that it&amp;rsquo;s by &amp;ldquo;Mariana Lin&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &amp;ldquo;Mariana Lin&amp;rdquo; in the Contacts list but I can&amp;rsquo;t say whether there&amp;rsquo;s any relation since we know that the names features don&amp;rsquo;t align with the contact details, being Apple employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;slides&#34;&gt;Slides&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a presentation on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park&#34;&gt;Yellowstone National Park&lt;/a&gt; created with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(presentation_software)&#34;&gt;Keynote&lt;/a&gt; and available as a &lt;code&gt;.key&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;slides.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Preview app displaying a preview of a Keynote slide. Visible is a picture of Old Faithful, a geyser at Yellowstone National Park. The slide talks about what makes geysers spew water.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presentation is attributed to Jamie Wong, Lauren Kerr and Greg Novick, none of whom appear in the Contacts listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume it&amp;rsquo;s also meant to be a school presentation as it&amp;rsquo;s pretty light on detail. I didn&amp;rsquo;t check if there are any presenter notes but I&amp;rsquo;m guessing there probably aren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, running &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_(Unix)&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across the file throws up a reference to &lt;code&gt;Data/GettyImages-451901451-8851.mov&lt;/code&gt; so it might include a video which would explain the beefy 236.5MB file size. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell where it features from using Preview and I don&amp;rsquo;t currently have Keynote installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;maps&#34;&gt;Maps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The installed version of Apple Maps contained 25 locations saved which were exported as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://fileinfo.com/extension/webloc&#34;&gt;webloc&lt;/a&gt; file that can be imported into Apple Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;maps.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Maps app. A map collection titled &amp;amp;ldquo;iPad Demo Unit Places&amp;amp;rdquo; is selected on the right. Visible in the main window is North America which depicts a number of bookmarked locations.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can actually view all of the locations on the web &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.apple.com/?ug=CglNeSBQbGFjZXMSDgiuTRCvqe7D1Ny%2B0c8BEg0Irk0Qz%2FvZ4ZWbx9tBEg4Irk0Q07KFg%2F%2FQ%2BrnQARIOCK5NEMeAvZu8zOeUtwESDQiuTRDI4rigp6nsmwoSDgiuTRDo%2Fqe%2FvObuqOkBEg0Irk0Q5K%2FmsO64yJlxEg0Irk0Q8ayI64Pohv4OEg0Irk0Q09rW7Kq%2BiJhkEg4Irk0Q4IWIktWzuN%2FrARIOCK5NEN%2FqnrONnc3%2FtQESDQiuTRDDnK%2Ffxefylm4SDgiuTRDO%2BLmCgoX4hIkBEg0Irk0QlqLPz%2B%2FCqu8kEg4Irk0Qxqnl%2FNTUhb3KARINCK5NEOjYh9WIyM7IQBINCK5NEMWgq%2BbIqN%2FzBBINCK5NELWBwaT3lZ7lFRINCK5NEOa0h4ye9qb3IhIOCK5NEL3vkc6h0JrS4wESDQiuTRCJidXtgZHQ4gQSDgiuTRCl45zH%2F5%2BYqfwBEg0Irk0Qs6KWyKqUs94NEg0Irk0Qy47O5vuQt5BgEg4Irk0Q8tnK55HulOvfARIOCK5NELKK3MOW3YeIhgE%3D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which is the link contained by the &lt;code&gt;webloc&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;photos&#34;&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned at the start, there are a great deal of photos but a lot of useful metadata requires them to be loaded into Photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;photos.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the macOS Finder app. Visible is a photo of a dog with metadata about the photo visible on the right side.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;They all have their original metadata which is interesting since there are a range of iOS devices used to take photos, not that I could ever take photos that nice with my own phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 437 photos in total although upon a quick skim, there are actually a couple of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime_File_Format&#34;&gt;mov&lt;/a&gt; videos as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this post wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly interesting to create but I figure it&amp;rsquo;s useful to capture since the odds of getting a demo unit are probably not that great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each category of file tends to have been created from the point of view of a single person so it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to know how much detail went into determining each persona in order to inform what the content should look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wonder what team would be in charge of preloading fake content onto a device. I guess it would fall into the realm of marketing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;d be kind funny telling your parents like &amp;ldquo;Yeah, I make fake content for iPads&amp;rdquo; or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as mentioned, I&amp;rsquo;m glad to finally cross this project off my list and delete these files from my desktop so they&amp;rsquo;ll stop judging me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, you can download all of the files referenced in this post &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/i-pad-demo-backup&#34;&gt;over on the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Fastmail with CalDAV libraries</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/fastmail-caldav/</link>
      <description>A guide to using Fastmail with CalDAV libraries which are often fiddly and struggle to find your calendars</description>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2022 20:20:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/fastmail-caldav/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a subscriber to &lt;a href=&#34;https://fastmail.com&#34;&gt;Fastmail&lt;/a&gt; now for probably a good five years at least, if not more at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a really nice service, not just for email but also email and contact hosting and for most clients, it all basically works out of the box as you might hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of services that integration with calendars tend to only offer &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Calendar&#34;&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt; integration but thankfully CalDAV integration pops up from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I think can be a little bit confusing for people is the Fastmail documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we visit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/1500000278342-Server-names-and-ports#calendar&#34;&gt;Server names and ports&lt;/a&gt; page, it mentions &lt;code&gt;https://caldav.fastmail.com/&lt;/code&gt; as the default server for clients with auto-discovery with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/360058752834&#34;&gt;a support page&lt;/a&gt; for other clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s perfectly correct but a number of CalDAV libraries I&amp;rsquo;ve seen around the place tend to complain about that base URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, I ran into this with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/davish/obsidian-full-calendar/issues/87&#34;&gt;obsidian-full-calendar&lt;/a&gt; where Fastmail integration was considered not working but really, the wrong server name was being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;https://caldav.fastmail.com/&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, odds are you&amp;rsquo;ll get what you&amp;rsquo;re after by using the following server name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://caldav.fastmail.com/dav/principals/user/user@example.com/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:user@example.com&#34;&gt;user@example.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the email address that you use for Fastmail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can confirm that by navigating to your Fastmail inbox and seeing what address in the top left corner if you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could also navigate to &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;Calendars&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;Export&lt;/code&gt; (on one of the calendars) and copy most of the section from &lt;code&gt;CalDAV URL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;calendar-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the author&amp;amp;rsquo;s Fastmail account, showing the Settings page. The Calendars tab is highlighted in the left sidebar. Three calendars are visible in the background with a modal open in the foreground. The modal has two sections: One deals with exporting a calendar. The other has a text box with the CalDAV URL for the selected calendar. An arrow is pointing to the text box. The contents of the textbox is highlighted up to the end of the segment containing the author&amp;amp;rsquo;s email. The ID at the end is not selected although this is not visible as it is blurred out.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting the whole URL will only load one calendar but odds are, whatever CalDAV client you&amp;rsquo;re struggling with will load all of your calendars by removing the calendar ID at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this work exactly? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m no expert here but I gave a brief overview of my understanding by way of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/davish/obsidian-full-calendar/pull/106#issuecomment-1120536933&#34;&gt;this Github comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For completeness, I&amp;rsquo;ve quoted it verbatim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested, Fastmail uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cyrusimap.org/&#34;&gt;Cyrus IMAP&lt;/a&gt; which is an all-in-one IMAP, CalDAV and CardDAV server. As I understand it, it &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cyrusimap.org/imap/concepts/features/dav-collection-mgmt.html&#34;&gt;represents calendars as mailboxes under the hood&lt;/a&gt; hence why you use your Fastmail address as the identifier. That is, you have a single &amp;ldquo;calendar&amp;rdquo; in the UI but you can have multiple calendars on it eg; one for Events, one for Work and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we can prove this by requesting a bogus calendar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ curl -u &amp;lt;fastmail-email&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;fastmail-app-password&amp;gt; https://caldav.fastmail.com/dav/calendars/user/&amp;lt;fastmail-email&amp;gt;/blah
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;404 Not Found&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Not Found&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mailbox does not exist&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;address&amp;gt;Cyrus-HTTP/3.7.0-alpha0-591-gfe6c3a2700-fm-20220427.001-gfe6c3a27 Cyrus-SASL/2.1.27 Lib/XML2.9.10 Jansson/2.13.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1n Wslay/1.1.1 Zlib/1.2.11 Brotli/1.0.9 Xapian/1.5.0 LibiCal/3.0 ICU4C/69.1 SQLite/3.34.1 Server at caldav.fastmail.com Port 2075&amp;lt;/address&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note how it is looking for a mailbox despite being a caldav server&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, your calendars are just email inboxes under the hood with Fastmail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, there is a mailbox per calendar (I think) and that mailbox is full of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar&#34;&gt;ics&lt;/a&gt; files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Plex &#43; Tidal = A Nice Match</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/plex-tidal-together/</link>
      <description>A lengthy post in which I gush about how I like Plexamp a lot due to how it integrates nicely with Tidal</description>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 13:20:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/plex-tidal-together/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;div class=&#34;notice&#34;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;🖼&lt;/span&gt;Look at this photograph&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of this post, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty image heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of the images are legible if you look at them inline so just a heads up that you can click on an image to view the full thing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;re probably aware, Spotify has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/2022/01/31/1076891070/joe-rogan-responds-spotify-podcast-covid-misinformation&#34;&gt;had a bit of news coverage lately&lt;/a&gt; regarding &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joe_Rogan_Experience&#34;&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the band &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_(band)&#34;&gt;Failure&lt;/a&gt; announced&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that they are going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/failure-remove-their-music-from-spotify-over-covid-controversy-enough-is-enough-3152537&#34;&gt;pull their music from Spotify&lt;/a&gt; in part because the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Spotify#Allegations_of_unfair_artist_compensation&#34;&gt;streaming payouts are supposed to be some of the worst in the industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to any of the above with accuracy nor is this a post about the ethics of the streaming model for artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m just a fan of Failure who figured they would take this opportunity to review other streaming services and see how they fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to find a setup that lets me listen to everything I enjoy, with as little friction, while still supporting the artists I care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution I&amp;rsquo;ve found that works for me, and that I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering in this post, is to stream most things via &lt;a href=&#34;https://plexamp.com/&#34;&gt;Plexamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It supports both streaming from &lt;a href=&#34;https://tidal.com/&#34;&gt;Tidal&lt;/a&gt; and playing content stored locally on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.plex.tv/&#34;&gt;Plex&lt;/a&gt; server, such as rips from games that never released official soundtracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everything else, I can purchase albums from &lt;a href=&#34;https://bandcamp.com&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;, including content that was &lt;a href=&#34;https://failureband.bandcamp.com/album/fantastic-planet-live&#34;&gt;never streamable&lt;/a&gt; in the first place, plus I can feel better that I&amp;rsquo;m better compensating the artists I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, you can either save yourself a solid 15 - 20 minutes and close the tab or if you&amp;rsquo;d like to read a deep dive into the bits and pieces that sold me on this setup, then I hope you enjoy what is now the longest post on this site to date 😮‍💨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-history-with-spotify&#34;&gt;My history with Spotify&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had Spotify Premium for a number of years as part of an offer with my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spark.co.nz/getmore/spotify/&#34;&gt;telco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their highest data plan, Spotify Premium is entirely free while lower plans give a partial subsidy&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually used the Spotify Free tier in any meaningful capacity.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered a lot of new tracks over the years with Spotify, my general usage pattern is that I replay the last 10 - 20 songs on my Liked Songs playlist and occasionally I&amp;rsquo;ll use the Song Radio feature on one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cycle repeats as I add more songs to Liked Songs and my &amp;ldquo;play window&amp;rdquo; slides up to include the new song and as a result, the last song dropped &amp;ldquo;outside&amp;rdquo; of the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my usage pattern, I&amp;rsquo;m not hugely worried about giving up custom playlists&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; like &amp;ldquo;Discover Weekly&amp;rdquo; that I know a lot of people swear by. Worst case, I can still view them in the free version of Spotify if I decide to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-ideal-criteria-for-a-replacement&#34;&gt;My ideal criteria for a replacement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post was never meant to be a comprehensive comparison of different services and what they offer but in saying that, it got a bit out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify, &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.apple.com/&#34;&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://tidal.com&#34;&gt;Tidal&lt;/a&gt; were the three main contenders that I compared based on the (arguably niche) criteria I care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s break down of those bits of criteria and how each service matches up against them, at least in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-good-api&#34;&gt;A good API&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has seen the little &amp;ldquo;Now Playing&amp;rdquo; widget on the front page of my site&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/gunslinger/blob/db5337d6e6846d3555540abaafb0bcba775c3cf2/jobs/spotify.go#L61&#34;&gt;powered by the Spotify API&lt;/a&gt; by polling every few seconds for what I&amp;rsquo;m currently listening to. I&amp;rsquo;d definitely want to recreate that functionality if I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, Spotify has the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/&#34;&gt;most comprehensive API&lt;/a&gt; of any streaming platform, even exposing the ability to control playback programatically which could make for some really cool projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;apple-music&#34;&gt;Apple Music&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Music is mostly ruled out here given their &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/&#34;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; is pretty lacking in general, especially when it comes to interacting with the current user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno what it is about Apple but reading their API documentation makes me feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been teleported back to 2006 with a bucket full of XML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just a cultural artefact from when they only dealt with desktop applications because all of their web offerings feel extremely bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tidal&#34;&gt;Tidal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tidal is also out as they &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TIDAL/status/699726946817679360&#34;&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t even have a public API at all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of unofficial API clients on Github but some of them haven&amp;rsquo;t seen much activity in recent times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did consider trying to hack something together myself but that&amp;rsquo;ll be addressed in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cross-platform-sessions&#34;&gt;Cross-platform sessions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something that Spotify really excels at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you play a song on mobile, you can continue it on your desktop and vice versa. By that, I mean you could either transfer the track to your desktop, picking up exactly where you left off, or you could continue on mobile while controlling the session from your desktop (ie; changing volume, pausing, switching song).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;spotify-remote-session.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Spotify desktop client open to the album White Pony by the band Deftones. The track &amp;amp;ldquo;Change (In the House of Flies)&amp;amp;rdquo; is currently playing. At the bottom of the screen is a green banner that says &amp;amp;ldquo;Listening on Marcus&amp;amp;rsquo;s iPhone&amp;amp;rdquo;. This indicates that the user is able to remotely control the session from their desktop.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was really handy at my previous job where trying to stream over a VPN&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was just asking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other times, I might be in the middle of a long podcast on mobile and I can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered transferring as I sit down at my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;apple-music-1&#34;&gt;Apple Music&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This&amp;hellip; sort of works on a technical level but still not really. I was disappointed here given that Apple generally has a decent track record when it comes to devices talking with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;apple-music-session.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Apple Music client open to the artist page for Missy Elliot. A share icon in the top right of the navigation bar has been selected, with multiple Apple devices visible such as a laptop, Apple TV and Homepod. The song Work It by Missy Elliot has just started playing. Visible in the share switcher is the ability to switch to the &amp;amp;ldquo;Lounge Room&amp;amp;rdquo;, in this case the Homepod, where ATM by J. Cole was previously playing.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Apple Music on my laptop is aware that I&amp;rsquo;m playing a song on an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/nz/homepod-mini/&#34;&gt;HomePod&lt;/a&gt;. I can then select the HomePod and pause the track which then reflects instantly on my phone as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, you can have sessions but only when the playing device is not an Apple Music client itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also ran into this fun popup when poking around and this won&amp;rsquo;t be the last time we see something like it in this post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;apple-music-too-many-devices.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Visible over a desktop wallpaper is a native macOS dialog popup. At the top of the popup is the Apple Music logo. The text reads &amp;amp;ldquo;More than one device is trying to play music. With a Family plan, up to 5 other people can stream their music at once.&amp;amp;rdquo; with the ability to select Not Now or Upgrade.&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tidal-1&#34;&gt;Tidal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While looking into whether I could pull session information out of Tidal, I realised that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have a concept of a current session. For example, if I play a song in the Tidal iOS app, the Tidal desktop client has no idea about any other clients. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t reflect in the API either, at least from the calls I could see it making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;artists-i-like&#34;&gt;Artists I like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This basically boils down to Failure who I previously mentioned and &lt;a href=&#34;https://edharrison.bandcamp.com/&#34;&gt;Ed Harrison&lt;/a&gt; given I listen to the Neotokyo OST a lot. Apparently Ed was my #1 artist in 2020 (according to Spotify Wrapped) with just over 2000 minutes (33.3 hours) which is&amp;hellip; pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;apple-music-2&#34;&gt;Apple Music&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has both Failure and Ed Harrison&amp;rsquo;s catalogue. I&amp;rsquo;m happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tidal-2&#34;&gt;Tidal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has Failure and some of Ed Harrison&amp;rsquo;s catalogue but not NeoTokyo. Honestly, this was a bit of a death blow for me as far as using Tidal by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidal did have Jay-Z content as an exclusive in the past, which also included the Jay x Kanye West crossover album &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_the_Throne&#34;&gt;Watch the Throne&lt;/a&gt; which I like a lot. This is no longer the case as Jigga released his catalogue on Spotify to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Spotify/status/1202090253839937536&#34;&gt;celebrate his 50th birthday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as I write this, I&amp;rsquo;m now learning that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vox.com/recode/22313268/tidal-square-jay-z-jack-dorsey-nft-explainer&#34;&gt;Hov sold the majority of his shares to &lt;strike&gt;Square&lt;/strike&gt; Block&lt;/a&gt; in 2021? What the fuck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I’m grateful for Jay’s vision, wisdom, and leadership. I knew TIDAL was something special as soon as I experienced it, and I’m inspired to work with him. He&amp;#39;ll now help lead our entire company, including Seller and the Cash App, as soon as the deal closes. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/YRfYjcWJQx&#34;&gt;https://t.co/YRfYjcWJQx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/xBtq2xfwue&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/xBtq2xfwue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; jack (@jack) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460921937817602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack Dorsey mentioned his vision for the future of Tidal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll work on entirely new listening experiences to bring fans closer together, simple integrations for merch sales, modern collaboration tools, and new complementary revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That basically means nothing to me but whatever. The Carter Administration is still on the board of &lt;strike&gt;Square&lt;/strike&gt; Block and that can only mean one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s29.q4cdn.com/628966176/files/images/board/blockheads-BOD-jayz.png&#34; alt=&#34;An image of Jay-Z from the Square website. More specifically, it is a 3D cube being displayed at an angle to the camera. Overlaid on the cube is an image of Jay-Z&amp;amp;rsquo;s face. This is supposed to be a play on the fact that investors in Block, the company previously known as Square, where employees are known as Blockheads. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s stupid.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-annoying-compromise&#34;&gt;An annoying compromise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, neither Tidal or Apple Music are hugely appealing based on the features I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re perfectly fine as streaming services but there&amp;rsquo;s another aspect I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned up to this point: Music stored on my Plex server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few rips&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; from various videogames that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Zn5I1xutE&#34;&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t have official albums&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve kept floating around my Plex server for a few years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aspire to listen to them more but I never get around to listening to them with Spotify as my daily driver as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support local files in any useful way&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It would be nice if there was a way to have both things in the same place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan at this point was going to be trying out Tidal since it had a relatively nice UI. To get around the lack of Neotokyo, I could just purchase Ed&amp;rsquo;s work from &lt;a href=&#34;https://bandcamp.com&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt; and load it onto Plex and just deal with the UX hassle of constantly switching between apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-perfect-candidate-appears&#34;&gt;The perfect candidate appears&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been vaguely aware for a while that Plex touted some sort of integration with Tidal but I had no idea what form it took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had even read up on integration, where the killer feature is &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.plex.tv/articles/add-tidal-content-to-your-plex-music-library/&#34;&gt;clearly outlined&lt;/a&gt; but apparently I did a rubbish job at reading since I entirely overlooked it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;plexamp-add-to-library.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Plexamp iOS application. It is open to Jay-Z&amp;amp;rsquo;s artist page where a few of his albums are visible. A menu is open at the bottom with a number of options including &amp;amp;ldquo;Add to Library&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Add to My TIDAL&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see that there are two buttons at the bottom of the screen: &lt;em&gt;Add to My TIDAL&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Add to Library&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first hooked up Tidal to Plex, I would just press &lt;em&gt;Add to My TIDAL&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, great, it adds albums to my TIDAL library remote through Plex. Big whoop. A few days later, I accidentally hit &lt;em&gt;Add to Library&lt;/em&gt; and oh my god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;plexamp-jak-jay.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A cropped image of the Plexamp macOS application is visible. It is open to the albums page with displays the cover art for a number of albums. Visible are a few Jay-Z albums, the Kane &amp;amp;amp; Lynch OST, the OSTs for Jak 2 and 3, a Pokemon OST and three Kanye West albums.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re telling me I can put Jay right next to Jak? Wrap it up, I think we&amp;rsquo;ve got a winner on our hands! At this point, I was sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to add virtual streaming items right next to my &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; (streaming from across the living room) items is pretty much the ideal outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness, Google Play Music offered something like this in the past but the idea of investing effort into a Google product is about as attractive as &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.youtube.com/googleplaymusic&#34;&gt;preordering a coffin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, with this, we can tick one piece of criteria off the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ for &lt;strong&gt;Artists I like&lt;/strong&gt; (1/3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-quick-note-on-plexamp&#34;&gt;A quick note on Plexamp&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we continue, I should note that I mostly interface with my Plex library (and Tidal) through &lt;a href=&#34;https://plexamp.com/&#34;&gt;Plexamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an audio player that &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/plexlabs/introducing-plexamp-9493a658847a&#34;&gt;started life back in 2017&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/plexlabs&#34;&gt;Plex Labs&lt;/a&gt; experiment, it has grown into an entire ecosystem, complete with mobile and desktop apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, it&amp;rsquo;s just streaming content from your plex server through a music-focused client. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require deploying any additional software. You can also listen to Podcasts (via Plex) on it too although I don&amp;rsquo;t do that myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tidal integration works perfectly fine with the regular Plex apps as well but the music section in general shines brightest when using Plexamp if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ok-but-how-well-does-it-actually-integrate-with-tidal&#34;&gt;Ok but how well does it actually integrate with Tidal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point in our tour, you might be thinking &amp;ldquo;Ok, sure but I bet under the hood, it&amp;rsquo;s just duct tape and chewing gum&amp;rdquo; which is definitely what I expected going in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, it really is a first class Plex citizen and I&amp;rsquo;ll even give you a whirlwind tour of my favourite features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cross-platform-search&#34;&gt;Cross-platform search&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether finding something new or something existing, you can search across your entire catalog and Tidal&amp;rsquo;s at the same time which is really appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;plexamp-cross-search.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Visible is a screenshot of the Plexamp iOS application. It is open to a search for the phrase &amp;amp;ldquo;Bad Company&amp;amp;rdquo;. The results are split into sections. The first section called &amp;amp;ldquo;Albums&amp;amp;rdquo; contains one result which is the OST for Battlefield: Bad Company 2. The next two sections are &amp;amp;ldquo;Tidal Artists&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Tidal Albums&amp;amp;rdquo; respectively which surface results relating to the phrase &amp;amp;ldquo;Bad Company&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-lively-home-screen&#34;&gt;A lively home screen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The home screen is a great example of how Tidal content is interweaved with your local content pretty seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that differentiates the two is a little logo tucked away next to the last played indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;plexamp-home.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Visible is a screenshot of the Plexamp iOS application. It is open to the home screen which is broken into a two sections: &amp;amp;ldquo;Recent Plays&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Recently Added in Music&amp;amp;rdquo;. More sections exist off screen. At the bottom is a currently playing song &amp;amp;ldquo;Empire State of Mind&amp;amp;rdquo; by Jay-Z.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s much more that isn&amp;rsquo;t illustrated here too. My library is still pretty empty (relatively speaking) but Plexamp will generate mixes for you like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/scrolling-mixes.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Visible is an animated GIF displaying a section of the Plexamp iOS homescreen. A &amp;amp;ldquo;Mixes for You&amp;amp;rdquo; section is being scrolled through, showing mixes for various artist. For example: a 2Pac Mix containing songs by various rap artists.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable automatic mixes, and other features, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to enable &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.plex.tv/articles/sonic-analysis-music/&#34;&gt;Sonic Analysis&lt;/a&gt;. I did a bit of a facepalm when I realised I didn&amp;rsquo;t have this enabled yet. I even read the blog post for it when it launched!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a feature for surfacing what happened &amp;ldquo;On This Day&amp;rdquo; in music history:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.plex.tv/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/on-this-day-crop-800x390.png&#34; alt=&#34;Visible is the cover art for the album She&amp;amp;rsquo;s the One by Tom Petty within a section called &amp;amp;ldquo;On this Day&amp;amp;rdquo;. It states that the album mentioned come out on this day 25 years ago.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would have said that February 10th&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is the 28th anniversary of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_College_Dropout&#34;&gt;The College Dropout&lt;/a&gt; if not for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/plexamp/status/1491497134851428352&#34;&gt;pesky oversight&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully it should be addressed soon so we can appropriately celebrate ye&amp;rsquo;s
29th debut next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;viewing-albums-by-mood&#34;&gt;Viewing albums by mood&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of cool groups like this such as albums by record labels and so on but mood is one of the more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;plexamp-mood.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Visible is a screenshot of a desktop with the Plexamp macOS application open. A list called &amp;amp;ldquo;Belligerent&amp;amp;rdquo; is open with a handful of albums that reflect that mood or feeling.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t taken it for a spin just yet but based on the premise, I can see myself using this quite a bit. It also demonstrates yet again how nicely the two sources (local and tidal) can play together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about time that we look at why they play nicely together so let&amp;rsquo;s take a peek under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hows-the-api-though&#34;&gt;How&amp;rsquo;s the API though?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you remember, something I wanted was to continue powering the &amp;ldquo;Now playing&amp;rdquo; widget on the front of my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;utf9k-nowplaying.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Visible is a screenshot of this website open in a small Safari window. Visible is a Now Playing widget showing Roses by Outkast. It reflects the song playing in Plexamp offscreen.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅ for &lt;strong&gt;A good API&lt;/strong&gt; (2/3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially playing Tidal content through the dedicated &amp;ldquo;Music On TIDAL&amp;rdquo; library&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t surface anything in the API but by virtue of adding items to our regular music library instead, we get full metadata available via the &lt;code&gt;/status/sessions&lt;/code&gt; endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Here&#39;s the absolute mountain of information available for you to play with&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34; data-lang=&#34;json&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;local&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;relayed&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;secure&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;userID&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can definitely work with that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to have multiple sessions at once, and Plexamp often takes a while for sessions to terminate upon closing the app but I just sidestep that by filtering for any sessions that aren&amp;rsquo;t paused. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there&amp;rsquo;ll be a section for gotchas like this later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll also put it into perspective that we&amp;rsquo;re accessing metadata about a third party playing track, in a world that would love to choke you out with Widevine gloves on the mat. Relatively speaking, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty refreshing to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as how this is possible, what&amp;rsquo;s really going on here is that Plex&amp;rsquo;s own metadata providers are doing the heavy lifting. When playing your local music, you get the exact same payload except for the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;attribution&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;com.tidal&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; entry at the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-cross-platform-sessions&#34;&gt;What about cross-platform sessions?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kind of but not really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&amp;rsquo;ll take 2 out of 3 happily but we&amp;rsquo;re apparently getting something in this space very soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;❌ but 👀 for &lt;strong&gt;Cross-platform sessions&lt;/strong&gt; (2/3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: For Valentines Day, we got &lt;a href=&#34;https://forums.plex.tv/t/plexamp-release-notes/221280/38&#34;&gt;a lofty 4.0 update&lt;/a&gt; which includes, among other things, the ability to control your playback on another device!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;plex-remote-session.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Visible in the background, but obscured by a popup, is the album Fantastic Planet by Failure. Overlaid is a widget asking the user to &amp;amp;ldquo;Select Player&amp;amp;rdquo;. Visible are two different players: The author&amp;amp;rsquo;s iPhone and the desktop currently playing Fantastic Planet. The implication here is that it is possible to transfer the currently playing album to another device on the network.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;re seeing here is my phone controlling a session that&amp;rsquo;s playing on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this was part of a larger refactor that unlocked a lot of capabilities, I assume we&amp;rsquo;ll see this fleshed out even more going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be updating this to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ for &lt;strong&gt;Cross-platform sessions&lt;/strong&gt; (3/3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;although my fingers are crossed that it gets to be even more seamless than it is in the first release!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ok-but-whats-the-catch-here&#34;&gt;Ok but what&amp;rsquo;s the catch here&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of fairness, nothing is perfect and there are few things I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled across while using this setup as my daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these are either fine in moderation or things that I&amp;rsquo;m sure the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/plexamp&#34;&gt;Plexamp team&lt;/a&gt; are aiming to address. If not, the team can consider this post as my bug report/feature request list!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hard-dependency-on-the-authentication-server&#34;&gt;Hard dependency on the authentication server&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had the misfortune of having this integration go down briefly due to an outage with the Plex authentication server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;plex-status-page.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Visible is a screenshot of the Plex status page cropped to show two sections: &amp;amp;ldquo;Authentication and API server&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Plex website&amp;amp;rdquo;. Visible for the first section a couple of outages over a 90 day period equally a total uptime of 99.81%.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one might imagine, we&amp;rsquo;re still at the mercy of (fairly invisible) DRM under the hood. No authentication server surely means no way to verify who has rights to play Tidal content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice&#34;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;🔑&lt;/span&gt;A tip for Plex server owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy&#34;&gt;Entropy&lt;/a&gt; is a sad fact of life and Plex&amp;rsquo;s authentication servers are no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re relatively stable but it&amp;rsquo;s inevitable that the authentication server will fail again one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;rsquo;t a slight towards Plex, it&amp;rsquo;s just an unavoidable reality about computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, to work around this in future, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.plex.tv/articles/200890058-authentication-for-local-network-access/&#34;&gt;whitelist your local network&lt;/a&gt; so that you can still stream (locally stored) content while you wait for the authentication server to return.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this sounds bad on paper, it&amp;rsquo;s not really an issue in that nothing stops me just opening Tidal itself and streaming music from there in the meantime. If you remember, Plex has an &amp;ldquo;Add to My Tidal&amp;rdquo; button and this is where it can be useful as a backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/&#34;&gt;SRE&lt;/a&gt;, albeit one currently off the clock, if I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk shit about availability then I should bring some data and so I did a brief skim of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://status.plex.tv/&#34;&gt;Plex status page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I added up the number of minutes elapsed for every publicly listed outage for the year of 2021 and got something just under 9 hours. That&amp;rsquo;s almost bang on 99.9% (three nines) which is a pretty standard expectation for services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably you&amp;rsquo;d hope for something closer to 99.99% (four nines) for a critical piece of infrastructure like that but eh, I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly doing math out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those incidents aren&amp;rsquo;t even attributed to authentication outages but I threw them in there just to look at the worst case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These outages, when they do happen, are generally about an hour long. The odds of hitting the same hour period in the same month is &lt;a href=&#34;https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2019/07/15/giant/&#34;&gt;pretty slim&amp;hellip; right?&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Plex for years prior to this and only run into them a couple of times although I will admit that music streaming is something that I do a lot more than visual media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion is that it&amp;rsquo;s fine. I&amp;rsquo;m not overly concerned! I have too many local tracks in my backlog to listen to so I&amp;rsquo;ll just take it as an excuse to go through unplayed content instead of consuming the same 5 Outkast albums on a loop until I die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, every service has outages. This problem isn&amp;rsquo;t unique to Plex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;drm-maybe-yes-maybe-no&#34;&gt;DRM&amp;hellip;? Maybe yes, maybe no?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stumbled onto this purely by accident but I guess you can&amp;rsquo;t stream Tidal content if you access your Plex server via your local network (ie; instead of via &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.plex.net&#34;&gt;https://app.plex.net&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to do so gave me an error dialogue with this message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An error occurred trying to play this item. Please make sure content from TIDAL is not already playing on another device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the message, nothing else was playing and despite my best effort, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get this to go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact same track would work via the hosted Plex app and I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m guessing there is some arbitrary legalese in the deal between Tidal and Plex that says &amp;ldquo;You must only load our content over an SSL connection&amp;rdquo; or something to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also just be a bug 🤷‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the error, it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly possible to play multiple tracks from Tidal at the same time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;tool-trio.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Visible is a cropped screenshot of the Plex media server dashboard. Visible are three Tool albums playing on three different Plex/Plexamp instances.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, here&amp;rsquo;s how the aural mashup shown above sounded&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;audio controls&gt;
    &lt;source src=&#34;tool-trio.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;
    Your browser doesn&#39;t support the audio tag :(
  &lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-cant-remove-tidal-albums&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t remove Tidal albums&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one seems like a weirdly obvious oversight so I&amp;rsquo;m going to give the benefit of the doubt here and assume there was some weird technical limitation that mean this was deferred to the backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team are definitely aware of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;1) On the roadmap, yeah, along with deletion of other things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Check in the web app when your release date is. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/iPXAjvyAMe&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/iPXAjvyAMe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Plexamp (@plexamp) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/plexamp/status/1491494752327372801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;February 9, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a little annoying though because I have added one or two albums accidentally and now they&amp;rsquo;re just stuck with me forever but amongst an ocean of albums, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;plexamp-sessions-are-weirdly-long-lived&#34;&gt;Plexamp sessions are weirdly long lived&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Plexamp sessions can&amp;rsquo;t be cancelled by the owner of a Plex server?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With most streaming content, you can force stop a session but here, you can&amp;rsquo;t even kill your own sessions for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;plexamp-not-pausing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Visible is a cropped screenshot of the Plex media server dashboard. Visible are two Plexamp streams on different devices.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this screenshot, I&amp;rsquo;ve actually paused &amp;ldquo;Praxis Palace&amp;rdquo; but the media server continues to show it progressing as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green padlock indicates that I can&amp;rsquo;t touch the session so I just sort of need to wait for it to expire on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the track reaches the end, the progress bar just jumps back to where I had gotten up to before closing the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fingers are crossed that this will probably be handled by the refactor that gives us controllability between platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;closing-thoughts&#34;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believe or not, I actually cut this post short because I could gush about Plexamp for quite a while longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, I was sold from the minute I was able to weave Tidal tracks alongside my local tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;plexamp-upnext.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Visible is a plain screenshot of the Plexamp desktop application with the song &amp;amp;ldquo;Praise the Lord (Da Shine)&amp;amp;rdquo; by A$AP Rocky playing.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to listen to a lot more game OSTs and while a heap were added to Spotify, there are still some really niche ones I kick myself for not getting around to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing that Plexamp offers me is the removal of friction between juggling multiple applications (in this case, Plex and Spotify) since the one I use heaviest will always dominate my focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this setup, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it because everything is in one place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually that feels like a red flag but I think the integration has been handled really elegantly here. It&amp;rsquo;s simply another provider for Plex with no more or less attention than every other provider. It just kinda works™.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will reiterate though that if you don&amp;rsquo;t care about local content, just use Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you balk at the thought of paying for both Plex and Tidal, maybe this also isn&amp;rsquo;t for you. Personally I&amp;rsquo;ve subscribed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/&#34;&gt;Plex Pass&lt;/a&gt; so many years in a row that I ended up just investing in a lifetime subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you like tinkering with APIs or you want to consolidate your library in one place, while not being enough of a masochist to build 100% of your library through local files, then maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this setup as much as I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plexamp definitely feels like a labour of love and all of the little UI string gag planted throughout the app promote that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the only question left now is whether I can bear to sully my library with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJunmC9YKQA&#34;&gt;untaggable content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that these claims are starting to take effect. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any doubt but if I had to guess, I figure there&amp;rsquo;s probably some process where Spotify waits out the calendar month in order to calculate compensation. It seems that Neil&amp;rsquo;s entire catalogue has disappeared at the time of publishing. Prior to this, he pulled his catalogue &lt;a href=&#34;https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/two-weeks-later-neil-young-finally-removes-his-music-from-spotify-1201550338/&#34;&gt;back in 2015&lt;/a&gt; due to &amp;ldquo;my music [being] devalued by the worst quality in the history of broadcasting or any other form of distribution&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On lower plans, they usually pay for half and you just pay the remainder. It shows as an add-on to your mobile plan but it&amp;rsquo;s a little more fiddly to setup than the higher data plan which just pays for the whole thing. If you use Spotify (as I did), it&amp;rsquo;s easy to write off an upgrade to the highest plan as being the same plan + a Spotify sub which you&amp;rsquo;d have purchased anyway.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, the first time I heard a Spotify ad was actually at a cafe that was using Spotify&amp;rsquo;s free version. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure that&amp;rsquo;s legal but damn, those ads really are annoying.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some people absolutely swear by Discover Weekly and while I think it is really good, I always forget to listen to it. I&amp;rsquo;m also not opposed to just viewing it once a week and listening to those songs via an alternative streaming plans. Hell, I might just be able to pull the playlist via an API endpoint and populate an identical playlist somewhere else?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, it shows TV shows, movies and music via Plex and even what I&amp;rsquo;m playing on my PS5 via the Playstation Network APIs. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write about it in a future blog post. It was previously powered by both Spotify and &lt;a href=&#34;https://trakt.tv&#34;&gt;Trakt&lt;/a&gt; before my switch though.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially given all of the traffic would transit through Germany while I lived in New Zealand. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t really the VPN though, more that the traffic passed through two or three different &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation&#34;&gt;NATs&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feature has degraded over the years so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure of the current state but last I checked, you can add local files to the desktop client. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually sync them like a la Google Music but instead just dumps them all into a basic list that you can play. If you open Spotify on a different desktop, you have to do the same process again from scratch.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first draft of this post was written on Feb 10th but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to editing it until Feb 12th hence this doesn&amp;rsquo;t really line up with the publication date.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two sources in Plex: One shows your Tidal library by itself and streams direct from Tidal. Given this, Tidal content doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up in the API, as the stream doesn&amp;rsquo;t transit via Plex. The other source is when you add Tidal content to your music library. This does transit via Plex so it shows up via the API.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do three audio fingerprints make a unique fingerprint? I hope the RIAA doesn&amp;rsquo;t destroy my blog or I might have to use one of those shady Swiss bulletproof hosts going forward&amp;hellip;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Some thoughts on what career I thought I might like as a kid</description>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those who read my blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that one of the long running arcs is documenting my thoughts as I enter each new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/blog/day-xero&#34;&gt;Day Xero&lt;/a&gt; was initially just a standalone post I slapped together as I departed for my first day as a member of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xero.com/nz/about/graduate/&#34;&gt;Xero graduate program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was since joined by &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/day-one&#34;&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mercedes-benz-trucks.com/content/mbo/markets/en_NZ/home.html&#34;&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/day-two&#34;&gt;Day Two&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vendhq.com/nz/&#34;&gt;Vend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and I&amp;rsquo;m sure in time there will inevitably be a few more entries but for now, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy where I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think too much about where I wanted to eventually end up nor did I ever actually expect to end up here in the first place. Back when I worked my shitty retail jobs, I was convinced that I had &amp;ldquo;missed the boat&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so I never had any solid ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the title of this post. I remembered about a year or so back that when I was younger, I had this dumb idea that I wanted to be a &amp;ldquo;skateboarding CEO&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I took it quite literally when I was younger but I think I what I actually found cool was the idea of constrast. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to break some expectations (and rules!) in a respectful way and as a kid, I was probably more interested in the idea of &amp;ldquo;being a unprofessional professional&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, I don&amp;rsquo;t focus so much on the CEO part&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as I do on the contrast bit. For anyone who follows me on social media, you&amp;rsquo;ll have noticed my recent &amp;ldquo;obsession&amp;rdquo; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumamon&#34;&gt;Kumamon&lt;/a&gt;, the loveable Japanese bear who represents the Kumatoto region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I do actually enjoy watching various bits of content by Kumamon after recently rediscovering him. I&amp;rsquo;ve actually found the fact that such ridiculous content can continue to exist, even in the midst of the confusing times we live in. Nothing gets rid of stress like popping open a video of a goofy bear falling over or whatever antics he&amp;rsquo;s up to this week but that&amp;rsquo;s besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other purpose of my silly &amp;ldquo;obsession&amp;rdquo; is that it acts as a type of contrast I alluded to earlier. Growing up, I always believed that to be successful meant being super serious and dedicated to a fault. You always see hackers and so on coding away into the wee hours of the night in movie and such. Well, this is my little contribution towards dispelling the idea&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that being or doing silly things is at odds with being capable. You can be both at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just Kumamon mind you. There are other things like some of my favourite shirts and what not but they all basically represent the same idea in some form or another. I also just find it funny, in an absurd sense, seeing myself in a goofy shirt while I default to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_bitch_face&#34;&gt;RBF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I can&amp;rsquo;t claim that it does or doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any effect, I also like to think that if anyone finds anything I do worth looking up to&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, that it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat comforting to know that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a super 10x hardcore asshole to accomplish things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I still took the &amp;ldquo;skateboarding CEO&amp;rdquo; idea literally, I would be (and was!) quite disappointed because it would be years and years until I accomplish it but by looking at it from a different angle, I realised that I already kinda made it there. At a smaller scale to be sure, but once you come to terms with the idea that bigger isn&amp;rsquo;t always better, it can be pretty comforting to have smaller, more achievable ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s probably enough of that for now. I&amp;rsquo;ve only really mentioned the above to one person I can think of but I figure it&amp;rsquo;d be handy to write it out so &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/zettelkasten-blog-a-good-idea/&#34;&gt;I can refer to it again in future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;ll change over time and I&amp;rsquo;ll believe in the idea of being a 20xer instead but either way, being able to review your trajectory through writing is a pretty neat idea and while I can&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy it so much, I hope someone down the line can enjoy seeing my years of progress condensed into a handful of posts and possibly get some use out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of a misnomer on my part since I never went to university. Instead I went near insane from 3 years of retail before attending &lt;a href=&#34;https://devacademy.co.nz&#34;&gt;Enspiral Dev Academy&lt;/a&gt; as a last ditch effort before giving up. That was complimented by years of being a hobbyist prior and a couple more years of doing side projects and being rejected from jobs before I finally got my entrance into the industry.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically I work for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lightspeedhq.com&#34;&gt;Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt; but I work on Vend. The product is referred to as Vend by Lightspeed but eventually we&amp;rsquo;ll just be part of Lightspeed. I don&amp;rsquo;t know for a fact that has been explicitly mentioned but it&amp;rsquo;s hardly a secret if you look at the trajectory on the public website.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually rejected from a university computer science course for not having enough math credits. Probably because I found Statistics boring and would skip class to go fiddle with HTML in the school library instead. Nowadays I have my rejection letter (aka &amp;ldquo;diploma&amp;rdquo;) framed on my desk at work.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large companies, especially anything VC funded, are overrated. Keeping it manageable with little to no debt is where it&amp;rsquo;s at if you ask me. Being propped up by large amounts of outside funding and becoming &amp;ldquo;planet scale&amp;rdquo; is just asking for a slow death in my book. Even worse is the idea of just bailing out at the IPO stage and leaving all of your employees holding the bag with a company that gets put into maintenance mode.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which I myself held in the past to a solid extent!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten two emails of thanks which is two more than I ever expected to get from this website. I also expect that &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/publish-old-works/&#34;&gt;old posts may get dug up in future&lt;/a&gt; without my knowledge at all which I look forward to. If not, that&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine because with my goldfish memory, I can enjoy my old posts. I once re-read &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/deepfakes&#34;&gt;deepfakes&lt;/a&gt; and thought &amp;ldquo;Damn, I never knew any of this.&amp;rdquo;. Of course, I did know it at some point but entirely forgot it all&amp;hellip;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Brief thoughts on crypto</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/brief-thoughts-on-crypto/</link>
      <description>It really is what it says on the tin: I have some thoughts about crypto</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 15:04:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/brief-thoughts-on-crypto/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come as any surprise that I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself a fan of blockchain derivatives such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short because when 1 unit of a currency is worth $54,000 at the time of writing, that sounds more like an investment vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you could go around having conversations like &amp;ldquo;Thanks, that&amp;rsquo;ll be 0.0000034 tokens for this loaf of bread&amp;rdquo; but at that point, it feels like the same problem as people who forget code, written in English, is for other humans and not for the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My head would hurt having to append 5 decimal places to everything just to participate in basic economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that isn&amp;rsquo;t really what got me to sit in my chair for once and start typing away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I understand it, the promise of NFTs is that you can buy a token that certifies you as the authenticated owner of something unique. At the moment, it&amp;rsquo;s primarily pieces of art that have been automatically generated but they&amp;rsquo;re 100% unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one has the exact same artwork as you do, unlike say; buying rare sneakers because even for businesses, the economics of producing physical things means a production run of just one probably isn&amp;rsquo;t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there&amp;rsquo;s the whole right clicker component but that has already done to death so let&amp;rsquo;s just put that aside for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that really confuses me is this uniqueness aspect. I mean, I &lt;em&gt;get it&lt;/em&gt; like the idea of being the sole owner of something is appealing to an extent but I don&amp;rsquo;t know where it ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, ok, hundreds of people have generated thousands of images, all of them slightly different in their own way but what gives it any value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more than just images though, it seems to be extending to just anything and everything from &lt;a href=&#34;https://foundation.app/@DisasterGirl/~/25046&#34;&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/McDonalds/status/1455174998264586243&#34;&gt;meals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we follow this down its logical path, why not sell individual atoms or points in history? None of these things have to actually be tangible or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.moonestates.com/&#34;&gt;reachable&lt;/a&gt; to command a market price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I sort of get it, if I squint a bit, from a individualist, &amp;ldquo;I would be cool to own X&amp;rdquo; point of view but philosophically, it feels like an entirely pointless exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything has a value, does anything have a value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably this is just human behaviour as old as time in a new form though. It&amp;rsquo;s not really any different than getting a trading card with your favourite sports player on it from your cereal box except it just so happens to be generated from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny though like one segment is the idea of interactivity between games such that you could bring a character model (you would own the NFT of it as proof?) into any game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure the coolest character model would cost like $200,000 but for a small fraction of that price, why not just hire an artist to create and rig a character model for you and issue yourself an NFT or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s all made up of course. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll check myself into the virtual insane asylum down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll end on a slightly related story from a few years ago where attended a bitcoin meetup back in like 2016 in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington&#34;&gt;Wellington, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. Some guy speaking was talking about how he was selling electricity back to the grid from his solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on to depict a future where everyone has their own solar panels and they buy electricity from their neighbours and everyone is an individual actor in the electricity market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure but that sounds exhausting doing it for every facet (gas, water etc) of home living. Surely, you would be tempted to outsource it to someone really into those things to run for your town and then it becomes their day job to manage for everyone. You just pay them monthly and they provide electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward though a few mergers, bankruptcies and so on and hold on a minute, we&amp;rsquo;ve just reinvented our existing infrastructure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all feels very silly like we&amp;rsquo;re just reinventing everything but worse and more convoluted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to have a nap.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day Two</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/day-two/</link>
      <description>Thoughts as I enter the third job of my career in the software industry</description>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 12:01:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/day-two/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://lightspeedhq.com/&#34;&gt;Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt; which means that it&amp;rsquo;s time for the sequel to &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/day-one&#34;&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, I write a new post summing up the excitement and concerns I have whenever I start a new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not actually sure if I&amp;rsquo;ve ever explicitly noted that this is intended to be an ongoing series but yeah, ideally I write a new entry every time I start a new job going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that I can look back and laugh at how much I did or didn&amp;rsquo;t know. I realise that from the shoes of a beginner, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to assume that long timers are magically gifted or Just Knew It All so in the event I make it somewhere interesting, this generally serves as proof that I had my doubts along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m actually quite overdue with this entry since I&amp;rsquo;m a little over a week into my new job already. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably keep it kind of brief as well since I keep staying up late&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but I did make a couple of quick notes that I&amp;rsquo;ll try to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;interviewing&#34;&gt;Interviewing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually don&amp;rsquo;t mind interviewing so much these days but I do dread the idea of getting some overly technical, google-esque interview. I never took computer science&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so if you ask me about B-tree&amp;rsquo;s or whatever then I&amp;rsquo;m out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, an interview prior to the ones with Lightspeed had me trying to write a sudoku solver. I gave it a crack but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to show so 10 minutes before I end, I just ended it early to save myself the humiliation. That said, I pretty confidently said that I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy this stuff, I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable saying as much and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t reflect what I do day to day anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I got to show a bit of everything across the stack in the Lightspeed interview with even a bit of frontend polish just for kicks :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It definitely wasn&amp;rsquo;t required but I opted to spend a bit of time on it. It&amp;rsquo;s good practice for sprucing up my website anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-first-day&#34;&gt;My first day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These posts don&amp;rsquo;t generally show when I&amp;rsquo;ve started but it&amp;rsquo;s probably a bit more appropriate (and relevant) of a timespan as my career progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a poke around a bunch of Slack channels and was in two minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly: wow, there&amp;rsquo;s some really cool best practice stuff going on. Secondly: Ahh geez, everyone is definitely going to be smarter than me and doing well crafted stuff while I&amp;rsquo;m super rusty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully everyone is really nice and the onboarding has been pretty comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;slos&#34;&gt;SLOs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, I saw a bunch of SLO monitors and my eyes probably dilated a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xero.com/nz/&#34;&gt;Xero&lt;/a&gt;, my team helped push the introduction of SLOs and I was in the SLO space for the better part of a year and a half and I still feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten all of it in some capacity, haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really stupid like I&amp;rsquo;ve run 3 part workshops on SLOs + alerting, helped teams instrument their products and my brain is still like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;quot;m very unqualified in this space&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure this happens with most every domain anyway. Once I get back into it and brush up on source material again, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll remember all the niche details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still such at math, and by extension statistics and what not though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically, I&amp;rsquo;m probably just scared that people will ask me questions on the spot I won&amp;rsquo;t have the answers to, as if that&amp;rsquo;s how it would go down. I also have an entire team I&amp;rsquo;m part of so that&amp;rsquo;s a dumb story to tell yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;work-life-balance&#34;&gt;Work life balance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time around, I&amp;rsquo;m definitely focusing on clocking in and out near enough on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I dislike my job, quite the opposite in fact. Thinking that the more hours you do magically correlates to more productivity is a lie. Productivity in general is a lie anyway. I have enough green cubes on Github without even trying, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts on this currently would just be a regurgitation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books&#34;&gt;Four Thousand Weeks&lt;/a&gt; by Oliver Burkeman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like a self help book but it&amp;rsquo;s not. Just a reminder that always striving towards things, for the sake of &amp;ldquo;productivity&amp;rdquo;, is not a good idea generally. It&amp;rsquo;s worth a read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;job-titles&#34;&gt;Job titles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me about a good week or so to put the &amp;ldquo;Senior&amp;rdquo; prefix in my bio and even then, I self-deprecatingly tacked &amp;ldquo;(allegedly)&amp;rdquo; on the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of myself as a Junior Senior, in that I just acquired this title but I guess it was bestowed upon me by passing a test so I guess I earned it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno, I feel the same and I often forget that I&amp;rsquo;ve quote unquote made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try not to think about it and remember that there&amp;rsquo;s a whole team I&amp;rsquo;m part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-team&#34;&gt;The team&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re all really nice people that I can&amp;rsquo;t fault or have any reservations about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to consciously be a little bit more myself by bringing the sillier aspects to work such as my &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumamon&#34;&gt;Kumamon&lt;/a&gt; obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, I really enjoy Kumamon but even more, I find the contrast of &amp;ldquo;an industry professional&amp;rdquo; being a big fan of a cute Japanese bear even funnier. I imagine it&amp;rsquo;s weirdly jarring but I also like that it forcefully breaks any illusion of being unapproachable or overly serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, my less serious aspects like shitposting people (although never punching down or sideways) via DMs have ended up being helpful for bridging teams who don&amp;rsquo;t communicate so easily. You can get to know individuals and figure out how to build ties with common elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone can equally laugh at my Kumamon obsession while knowing that I&amp;rsquo;m in on the joke for example. Maybe it helps ultimately build a squillion dollar product that ultimately would have fallen apart if things were too serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno, I just want to build useful software and learn things anyway. Getting too invested into any single business, that may ultimately collapse at the whim of a newly-installed post-IPO board, is a bit of a mistake waiting to happen so just enjoy it while it lasts :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;now-what&#34;&gt;Now what&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still onboarding and perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll have more to write about career stuff. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be pretty happy here for a while and I&amp;rsquo;ve got quite a bit to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With lockdown again here in New Zealand and my &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/ride-the-curve/&#34;&gt;brief health issues earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, I had purposely decided not to think about work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I was invited by the recruiter to interview so I never really plan to work here, it all came as quite a surprise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more technical posts I&amp;rsquo;ve written, such as &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/conditional-gitconfig/&#34;&gt;Conditionally setting your gitconfig&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/wsl2-vhd-issue/&#34;&gt;Fixing a WSL2 VHD conversion issue&lt;/a&gt;, continue to gain quite a bit of traffic which is interesting since I don&amp;rsquo;t do very much promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some vague intention to dig through manpages and what not to see what other niche things I can dig up. I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to turn this site into some sort of &amp;ldquo;Top 5 Git Commands&amp;rdquo; hellhole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that a few people reached out to me as a result, I&amp;rsquo;m aware that more than a few seem to have gotten real value out of problems that I was just solving for myself ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;/questions&#34;&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt; section is still the place to go for brief, niche snippets but I would like to do some deep dives in future if anything useful comes out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever, I&amp;rsquo;m just rambling at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time, see ya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unrelated to work, just doomscrolling Twitter too much.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Twitter, could you please fix your image servers?</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/twitter-image-servers-2021/</link>
      <description>Throughout the year of 2021, I have run into a number of issues with Twitter&#39;s image servers</description>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 12:18:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/twitter-image-servers-2021/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For anyone who knows me, it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that I&amp;rsquo;m horribly addicted to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I joined back in 2009&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen into more &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/automation-right/&#34;&gt;technical rabbit holes&lt;/a&gt; than I care to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Twitter user who is Very Online, I love to theorise about why services go wrong and poke fun at corporations but as an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering&#34;&gt;SRE&lt;/a&gt; myself, I find it very difficult to direct blame at people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about Twitter in the brand/persona sense and not as a reflection of the many people who I&amp;rsquo;m sure work tirelessly behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might say they&amp;rsquo;re one in the same but my general principle is that taking aim at the marketing facade is fair game while the people themselves are off limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that we&amp;rsquo;ve addressed that, I feel like the Twitter &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo; has been degraded for a couple of months now with no real acknowledgement that I can see. In short, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Twitter DMs intermittently fail to load, images being corrupted upon upload and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1440428582308757507&#34;&gt;replies failing to load&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be walking through the former two issues as they&amp;rsquo;ve been plaguing both myself and some friends the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, I&amp;rsquo;m nothing but a simple armchair critic who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any real recourse in this abstract digital &amp;ldquo;customer support&amp;rdquo; hell we&amp;rsquo;ve constructed for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides trying to raise awareness publically by writing this post, I have absolutely no idea if this has any traction internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at what has been going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;twitter-dm-images-failing-to-load&#34;&gt;Twitter DM images failing to load&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one has been bugging me and some Twitter mutuals for at least a couple of months now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens is that intermittently, images will fail to load inside of direct messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times, it isn&amp;rsquo;t that every image fails to load but one or two that have been recently uploaded. In hindsight, it may be that they all fail to load but prior images are loaded from cache now that I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads to frustrating discussions like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;twitter-dm-huge-l.png&#34; alt=&#34;A Twitter direct message where the author posts an image that fails to load and the recipient says &amp;amp;ldquo;huge L the image isn&amp;amp;rsquo;t loading&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;and this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;twitter-dm-alt-text.png&#34; alt=&#34;A Twitter direct message where the author receives an image that fails to load, asks &amp;amp;ldquo;got any alt text?&amp;amp;rdquo; and the other person responds with an accessibility style description of what is in the image. The tone of the interaction is one of lighthearted humour.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;and this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;twitter-dm-revenue.png&#34; alt=&#34;A Twitter direct message where the author receives an image that fails to load and responds with &amp;amp;ldquo;Guess who has $3 billion in revenue but still can&amp;amp;rsquo;t display photos in DMs :)&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happened again just the other day and I did a little poking around. It seems that &lt;code&gt;ton.twitter.com&lt;/code&gt;, the image server used for DMs&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; times out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;timeout.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of a terminal window with two curl commands. The first is requesting an image link over http port 80 in verbose mode. It responds as expected, with the content being a redirect to https. The second command is the prior link but accessed via https and it fails with a timeout.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon closer inspection, only Port 80 (http) appears to be open with redirects to Port 443 (https) failing as there is no such port open based on a quick scan using &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty frustrating and I&amp;rsquo;ve actually resorted to DMing on other platforms because of how unstable this can get at times!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;images-being-mulched&#34;&gt;Images being mulched&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a period of about 2 weeks, images with transparency such as macOS screenshots were being absolutely destroyed upon upload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1439536308326645767&#34;&gt;@benedictevans has since set their account to private so here&amp;rsquo;s a direct link if you follow them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see it looks like someone took the spray can from MS Paint and went to town on the edges of the image. That is supposed to be a nice crisp drop shadow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;well now, apparently the logitech client i installed has attempted to communicate with discord &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/Uq0T1jwMYQ&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Uq0T1jwMYQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Marcus (@sentreh) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sentreh/status/1436092048914796545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this appears to have been fixed recently, it was also not acknowledged as far as I can tell. Just kind of weirdly broken in plain sight for days on end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;closing-thoughts&#34;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too much to conclude that these are both image related issues which is interesting but it would be a logical leap to conclude that there is any relation between the image processing pipeline and the DM image server so any further speculation would be just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to point fingers at any people but I will say that it frustrated me to no end seeing no acknowlegement of this happening continually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, right in the middle of those two transparency mulched images, what I experienced was &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TwitterEng&#34;&gt;@TwitterEng&lt;/a&gt; was talking about mechanical keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Today, we&amp;#39;re talking about switches... keyboard switches ⌨️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Choose your fighter. When it comes to the best tactile response, which clickety-clack rules them all?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&amp;#39;re loving TTC Bluish Whites 👀&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Engineering (@XEng) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/XEng/status/1437857022444138496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m being a bit flippant mind you since it can be true that one team is doing community building while another is working on technical issues of course but at the same time, the optics of it don&amp;rsquo;t look great as someone experiencing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, really all I want is to be able to use DMs again reliably!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that we&amp;rsquo;re probably going to get the ability to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TheSmarmyBum/status/1443259893411049475&#34;&gt;an NFT as an avatar&lt;/a&gt; or whatever else is cooking over there sooner than a fix :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few years, I&amp;rsquo;ll have been on Twitter longer than I&amp;rsquo;ve been off it (ie; before I registered/before it existed)&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, &lt;code&gt;ton&lt;/code&gt; is used for DMs while &lt;code&gt;pbs&lt;/code&gt; is used for the public timeline?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Who is software even for?</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/who-is-software-even-for/</link>
      <description>Maybe it&#39;s for you? Maybe it&#39;s for me? Maybe it isn&#39;t for any of us!</description>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 21:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/who-is-software-even-for/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post is very much written spur of the moment, presumably with the idea that it will help contribute to treating my blog as a &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/zettelkasten-blog-a-good-idea/&#34;&gt;zettlekasten&lt;/a&gt; of ideas to think more about in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374159122&#34;&gt;Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals&lt;/a&gt; earlier today and I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the name, it&amp;rsquo;s very much not a self help book and instead is about accepting the inevitability of death. If you can manage that, you&amp;rsquo;ll come to truly understand that this idea that you can do, or manage everything on your plate is a big lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an entirely unrelated note, I went to get a kebab just before and I was thinking about how most software doesn&amp;rsquo;t really feel designed for fallible humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particular scenario is that I quite like using &lt;a href=&#34;https://feedbin.com/&#34;&gt;Feedbin&lt;/a&gt; as my RSS reader but if I go for an extended period of time without actually reading anything, it piles up until I have something like a thousand unread items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is a false idea. I am not going to read 1000 items and a lot of them are small snippets such as Hacker News comment feeds but perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really wonder is why there isn&amp;rsquo;t a button to say &amp;ldquo;I was sick for 2 weeks and please just surface my most prioritised feeds&amp;rdquo;. In the absence of such a thing, I&amp;rsquo;m left to curse myself for not being a fallible robot and if only I had put in the work, in periodic chunks, each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going even further off this idea, it does kind of feel like most software is not really designed for humans. Particularly, mere mortals who get sick or are distracted easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, systems that start out being able to ease stress can become much more daunting when you forget the underlying concepts that back them. Worse still, you might have valuable information &amp;ldquo;stuck&amp;rdquo; in them so you&amp;rsquo;re trapped at the mercy of remastering a system once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, it&amp;rsquo;s wading through the depths of a messy &amp;ldquo;task management&amp;rdquo; system only to throw my hands up in the air. It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to start with a fresh new competitor that will totally not get messy and I will check in every single day to keep things curated I swear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either further still, if this feeling is even somewhat true, it raises the question then: &amp;ldquo;Who is software even for?&amp;rdquo; because it can often feel like it&amp;rsquo;s built for idealised humans, if not gods, who remember every CLI flag and have the energy to parse acres of manpages. Anything less feels like treating water because you can&amp;rsquo;t express your will through your fingers in any redeeming fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m being a bit ridiculous and speaking in broad strokes here but I do feel this way from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we pretend that it is true for a bit, just think how many billions, no, trillions have been wasted on lopsided shit that isn&amp;rsquo;t really enhancing anything for anyone. Maybe for bursts of time but in the grand scheme of things? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was about the extent of my soul searching before I made it back home anyway. I still need to eat my dinner which is probably getting cold by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up, Four Thousand Weeks would have you know that the answer is also not dedicating your life to endless vacation either because that too is simply just another form of trying to feel endlessly productive by another means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting down and just doing what&amp;rsquo;s enjoyable, because you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have time at all is about the best anyone can strive towards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, that should really mean touching less software and being Less Online but adjusting yourself to truly believe it in your bones is the hardest part of all, especially with the addictive nature of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think expressing it in writing helps and I can always come back here to remind myself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking holidays is important</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/taking-holidays/</link>
      <description>Relaxing some of the time is a good idea. Who would have guessed?</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 22:04:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/taking-holidays/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not good at practicing this but while reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Generation-Microsoft/dp/0029356717&#34;&gt;Show Stopper!&lt;/a&gt; a few years back, I noted that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Cutler&#34;&gt;Dave Cutler&lt;/a&gt; was big on always taking holidays on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even tried to email him once to ask why but unfortunately I had no luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone who led the development of the NT kernel among many other projects at Microsoft, this was completely at odds with the workaholic stereotype so often associated with Silicon Valley &amp;ldquo;10xers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I try to take holidays more often. I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely rubbish at it but this post serves as a reminder to think about it even more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conditionally setting your gitconfig</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/conditional-gitconfig/</link>
      <description>Did you know you can change Git attributes based on what folder you&#39;re in?</description>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 20:17:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/conditional-gitconfig/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Personally, I try to keep my development environment as convenient to use as possible and with the advent of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp&#34;&gt;BeyondCorp-style zero trust&lt;/a&gt;, more internal services are thankfully available without a VPN required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes it easy to access tooling from your mobile device and other places but it can also mean the line between work and personal blurs a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my custom work-related configuration has been deprecated (utilities for wrangling VPNs and proxies) and I basically don&amp;rsquo;t maintain anything more than what was &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/dotfiles&#34;&gt;already open sourced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last holdout has been my git configuration however, as I want to create work commits with my work email and vice versa for open source commits. It had been my impression that git had no way to support this but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been true for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_conditional_includes&#34;&gt;conditional includes&lt;/a&gt;, you can dynamically switch instances of your &lt;code&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt; on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at an example. For example purposes, let&amp;rsquo;s say that my code lives in &lt;code&gt;$HOME/work&lt;/code&gt; and my personal code lives in &lt;code&gt;$HOME/projects&lt;/code&gt;. You can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; user@example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; User
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;signingkey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ABC123
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;commit&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;gpgSign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;includeIf &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;gitdir:~/work/&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ~/.work.gitconfig
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;rsquo;re doing here is setting our default variables but upon interacting with a &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; initialised repository within the &lt;code&gt;~/work&lt;/code&gt; folder, we instead use our work-based config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example of this in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;/Users/person
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; git config user.email
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;user@example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/work
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;/Users/person/work
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; git config user.email
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;business@work.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating debug reports with Hugo inline shortcodes</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/hugo-debug-reports/</link>
      <description>I teach you some tricks on introspecting your Hugo builds</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:50:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/hugo-debug-reports/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I discovered that &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; added support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/&#34;&gt;inline shortcodes&lt;/a&gt; like 30 versions ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bep&#34;&gt;bep&lt;/a&gt;, the reason I had never heard about them was simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t ask ... (we added that to get the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/getbootstrap?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@getbootstrap&lt;/a&gt; site on Hugo, they had lots of inline scripting) ...&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bjørn Erik Pedersen (@bepsays) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bepsays/status/1408348824083615745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-shortcode-refresher&#34;&gt;A shortcode refresher&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give an idea of what this means, here&amp;rsquo;s a reminder on how you were required to use shortcodes in the past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- layouts/shortcodes/notice.html --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;notice&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{{ .Get &amp;#34;title&amp;#34; }}&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  {{ .Inner }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- content/blog/example-post.md --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;# This is an example post
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{{ notice title=&amp;#34;This is a notice&amp;#34; }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the content inside of a notice shortcode
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{{ /notice }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Minor caveat with shortcode syntax&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the shortcode internals live in your &lt;code&gt;layouts&lt;/code&gt; folder, and have access to your &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; context as well as all of the various Hugo functions. Your post is only able to pass parameters into the shortcode itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to be clear, there&amp;rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with doing this. In principle, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea for your content to not have any awareness of how it&amp;rsquo;s being rendered. If you were to change the internals of the notice shortcode once, all of the pages it appears in are instantly updated upon the next render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In saying that, the introduction of inline shortcodes allows us to do some fun things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- content/blog/example-post.md --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;# This is an example post
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check out some of these funny gags I wrote:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{{ readfile.inline }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{{ range $.Site.Data.gags }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{{ . }}&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{{ end }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{{ /readfile.inline }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Minor caveat with shortcode syntax&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? Here&amp;rsquo;s that same inline shortcode embedded in this very post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Check out these fun gag lines I wrote&lt;/summary&gt;
  
&lt;ul&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Has anyone seen my keys? I dropped them in here somewhere...&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;My bluetooth is disabled but I only have bluetooth devices. How do I turn it back on?!&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Is good software a myth? Perhaps we&#39;ll never know&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;The IETF announces BNS - Baby Name System&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;If text is sublime already, how can there be a sublime text 2?&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Why is it called venture capital if you can just apply for it without walking anywhere?&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;What does the Y in YCombinator stand for?&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;The invention of sport was a mistake!&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Besides Tele, how many other types of vision are there?&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;When are they going to air Who Wants To Be A Crypto Millionaire?&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;What if NASA was the result of a typo in a government memo proposing &#34;Spice exploration&#34;?&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;What does the &#34;work&#34; in network refer to? There&#39;s no such thing as a netrelax after all&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;You have 341 new emails.&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;What even is a TPS report?&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Do you think anyone has ever been killed by a judge&#39;s gavel?&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;I haven&#39;t used a mailbox in quite a long time!&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Thanks for reading this far! I guess you enjoyed the content, hmm?&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;I don&#39;t have any good fuel fun facts. I don&#39;t even drive!&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Did you know solo camping is a thing? I should try it sometime.&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Budgeting is hard. You should try to save a little more for that rainy day!&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;I only ever see baths in hotels. What if they end up becoming extinct?!&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;An internet connected sandwich maker wouldn&#39;t be so bad, would it?&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Someone who is good at the economy please help me plan my startup runway&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;:wq!&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Apparently you&#39;re supposed to feel rested after sleep but I haven&#39;t read the literature myself&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of these look familiar, I just used an inline shortcode to read from the same file that powers the footer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t used inline shortcodes to their full potential yet but I&amp;rsquo;d like to use it to add a bit more flavour to posts in future where having a dedicated shortcode would be a bit overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;ll always have their place of course! Pick the right tool for the job and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that brings me to the actual topic at hand: debug reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-hugo-debug-itself-for-you&#34;&gt;Let Hugo debug itself for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are always some unknowns to any site like &amp;ldquo;Do any links throw a 404?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Are there posts without a description?&amp;rdquo; and to shed some light on the current situation, we can get a bit meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easiest if you just check out the &lt;a href=&#34;/debug&#34;&gt;debug&lt;/a&gt; section of my site for yourself but the short version is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using inline shortcodes to write one off custom reports, that effectively answer these questions through introspection. That&amp;rsquo;s just a fancy way of saying I write Hugo content (reports) that show the status of other Hugo content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t anything super complex at the moment but I used it to clean up posts where the &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/debug/file-url-match/&#34;&gt;folder names didn&amp;rsquo;t match slugs&lt;/a&gt; as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They automatically update every time the site rebuilds so while I could keep a spreadsheet, this is a nice way of keeping that useful information close to where the action happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/debug/reports-todo/&#34;&gt;a list of various reports&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ll consider generating going forward and some will be a bit more tricky than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, the most interesting ones will just be reading from data sources generated by external scripts running either locally or via a CI pipeline. It&amp;rsquo;s nicer to see all this information on one place even if I could just read the logs from my terminal or a pipeline run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, and before I forget, the actual source for the reports &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/utf9k/tree/main/content/debug&#34;&gt;is visible on Github&lt;/a&gt; so feel free to borrow anything you&amp;rsquo;d like to use for your own site. They&amp;rsquo;re pretty naively written but they get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve given you something to consider and if you think of any interesting report types that aren&amp;rsquo;t on my list, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hello@utf9k.net&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear about them!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above isn&amp;rsquo;t actual syntax but near enough. If I were to type it properly, the shortcode would really render, whereas I&amp;rsquo;m trying to demonstrate the shortcode internals themselves. To find some real shortcode syntax, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; section of the Hugo docs.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Time Dilation</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/time-dilation/</link>
      <description>Historically, I am often late to a bunch of things even though I plan ahead some of the time</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 22:53:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/time-dilation/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A more accurate title would probably be something like &amp;ldquo;Time Inflation&amp;rdquo; but I think &amp;ldquo;Time Dilation&amp;rdquo; sounds cooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m planning a trip anywhere, often just across town, I tend to tack on an extra portion of time. Usually just 10 or 15 minutes as a bit of a buffer and depending on the mode of transport, it tends to get eaten up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that I don&amp;rsquo;t really go back and re-evaluate how long it takes to get places. The next time I plan a trip, I tack on an extra portion of time. Usually just 10 or 15 minutes and&amp;hellip; hold on a minute, didn&amp;rsquo;t we already account for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure there are some things that I just don&amp;rsquo;t even bother doing at all because I&amp;rsquo;ve built this big time sink out of it when in reality, it won&amp;rsquo;t take very long at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember taking the bus somewhere not that long ago and I was surprised that it only took a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, buses like most vehicles are quite fast on land but I guess my perception of time got a bit mangled somewhere along the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony of this of course, is that I waste large swathes of time checking the same five websites for updates, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t really class as procrastination until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s not really a moral to the story or anything like that but re-evaluating what you think you know from time to time can never hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, it&amp;rsquo;s always a good idea to let your streaks end when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I took up journalling just before the start of October of 2020 and had an unbroken streak until the middle of December 2020. I picked it up again in the middle of January and it ran all the way until the start of June when I had a particularly troubling &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/ride-the-curve/&#34;&gt;life event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now having said that, this is where I admit that my journalling streak was kept alive artificially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually fill out each entry on each given day but instead, I would forget about it and backfill days (or even a week!) at a time. At that point, it should have become clear that the act of journalling, in and of itself, wasn&amp;rsquo;t compelling enough to keep me interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sit back and think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s probably fair to say that I was more invested in the aesthetics of keeping a journal more than the journal itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dayoneapp.com/&#34;&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt; has a cool feature for &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/769055-book-printing&#34;&gt;printing books&lt;/a&gt; and the idea of having a coffee table book&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was very cool but these are all side effects of journaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s ok to pursue a habit as a means to the actual thing you want to achieve but just as long as you&amp;rsquo;re aware of the potential pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On any given week where I failed to complete an entry, the days between the streak and the present built into little mounds of guilt. Nothing bad mind you but just enough to think &amp;ldquo;I need to backfill this entire week&amp;rdquo; to keep the streak going. My recollection of what I did a week before, was of course nowhere near as detailed as if I had captured it while it was fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, while the streak icon was burning brightly, I was well aware in my mind that the flame had gone out long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I resolved to only fill in a journal entry if I naturally felt compelled to, it was actually quite freeing. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to think about the artificial guilt that comes with completionism&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, some things I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided to explicitly grow a streak in, such as reviewing &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; bookmarks, have since developed into their own streaks naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure these too will end too when the time is right and that&amp;rsquo;s completely fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you could say the same of relationships too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--- Written with A.I in mind --&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I actually have a coffee table, or lounge, mind you!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A riduculous idea of course, since I&amp;rsquo;m missing journal entries ranging from my birth to my 25th birthday. There&amp;rsquo;s literally no way anyone can ever &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; a journal or backfill the pages.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This goes out to anyone who does marketing for startups and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re about to announce something like an update for those on a waitlist or a big bang version 2, please include a reminder of what your service actually is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t count the number of times I receive an email out of the blue saying &amp;ldquo;Smergen is nearly here!&amp;rdquo; only for me to scratch my head out of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decent improvement is to just include screenshots (but not those vague &amp;ldquo;big tech art&amp;rdquo; things, real ones!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual fix is just to include a one liner like &amp;ldquo;Smergen - the app that lets you map public toilets&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really drive it home, here&amp;rsquo;s a masterclass in retaining the user from &lt;a href=&#34;https://nvultra.com&#34;&gt;nvUltra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;nvultra.png&#34; alt=&#34;An email snippet from nvUltra explaning how they have been infrequent with updates and then providing a detailed reminder on what nvUltra actually is, in simple english.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t take a few seconds to provide some context for what your announcement is about, I can&amp;rsquo;t get excited or even bring myself to care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A post from a darker time on how to better think about taking a break</description>

      <content type="html">&lt;div class=&#34;notice&#34;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;🚣‍♀️&lt;/span&gt;It&amp;#39;s rough seas out there!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, I was struggling with instances of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization&#34;&gt;something very unfamiliar&lt;/a&gt; , which scared the shit out of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of many distractions, I popped open a text editor and started writing about my life so far and this is what came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve strongly resisted the urge to make any edits, beyond adding links for context. All footnotes were already written inline with the draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t fully reread it nor do I really intend to. I also never got to the actual point of the title, which is what I started off with as a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to relax more and look after myself. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean stopping work but riding the momentum I already built up, whether I realise it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, I tend to worry a lot about what things might look like in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it all turns to custard, will I have transferrable skills that are sought after?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tendency is to frame the tech industry as a sort of gold rush that sooner or later will dry up. I imagine that maybe it will hit market saturation or be dismissed due to intense distrust thanks to key/buzzwords like Surveillance and Algorithms that always seem poised to spiral out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;del&gt;some&lt;/del&gt; most ways, this is a ridiculous thing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly because an industry that can service other industries (see: accounting, consulting, compliance etc) rarely run out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, most things are cyclical so a crash here will peak once again over there. We only have to look at various bubbles and crashes (see: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble&#34;&gt;the dotcom boom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008&#34;&gt;Global Financial Crisis&lt;/a&gt; or even the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_recession&#34;&gt;Coronavirus Pandemic&lt;/a&gt; which is still ongoing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the final and true answer is that no one can know the future. We can predict things, often with some accuracy but us humans are unpredictable so even sane assumptions can fall apart in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abandoning-ship&#34;&gt;Abandoning ship&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was towards the end of my teenage years (I&amp;rsquo;m only 26!), I figured I had missed the boat when it came to &amp;ldquo;Computer Science&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked messing around with web pages and I thought the internet was fascinating despite only having a vague understanding of how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember trawling through forum posts for MMOs and absolutely loving the technical explanations of why Final Fantasy 14 developers &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6h4129/yoshida_acknowledging_glamour_importance/divdh85/&#34;&gt;struggled to allocate more bag slots&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/125277-Triple-Monitor-Display?p=1631847&amp;amp;highlight=Minagawa#post1631847&#34;&gt;the troubles with aspects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, and years of trawling &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; daily which built up a fairly solid vocabulary, I never actually properly started programming until what I thought was quite late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I considered myself a hobbyist and had dabbled in a bit of Python but I didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; any of it for a long time, probably since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a mental model to hang any of it in a useful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I distinctly remember &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34066941&#34;&gt;some BBC article came out ranking the likelihood of job automation&lt;/a&gt; had came out in my third year of retail. It listed retail workers as having something like a 97% chance of being automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I think back on that and find it kind of funny. Due in part to being a technical hobbyist, I would daydream about automating parts of my job and thinking about how inefficient the systems seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably for that reason, I thought I could &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; it coming, like a rising tide that would swallow me up and that fear was a useful, although probably not healthy motivator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between that fear and a general sense of worthlessness and disappointment, I decided to throw my eggs in one basket and attend a web development bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure for some, it was just a brief chance to dabble in a profession to see if they&amp;rsquo;re interested but for me, at that time, I felt it was my last chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saddled with the idea of spending the next 50+ years, pushing shopping carts and being derailed into conversations that amounted to &amp;ldquo;What if the store just simply made everything more efficient&amp;rdquo; for the 600th time, I honestly did not expect to live this long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as for how I came up with the funding: Doing a lot of saving coupled with a bank loan for a &amp;ldquo;cruise to Japan&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;actually-finding-a-job&#34;&gt;Actually finding a job&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://devacademy.co.nz/&#34;&gt;a bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; was a step in the right direction and a chance to understand the industry but I will never claim you can attend one and instantly become a fully fledged developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people were lucky and found side jobs or internships relatively quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was arguably unlucky in that I persisted for an extra year on minimal savings and spent what felt like the majority of every day pouring over crap, building side projects and doing tutorials, filling out job applications and probably trying to not cry a lot of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, a man in his 40s or so moved into our flat at one point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, he seemed fine but progressively shared some conspiratorial views until I found out he was literally a white supremacist. I&amp;rsquo;m not misusing the term literally here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of his friends once talked about beating me to death while I was in my room, with the lights of, pretending to be out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inspired me to learn how to set up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.com/&#34;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; bot that would poll our router for connected devices and I could query to see if I felt safe to come home. Odds are, if he was home, he was in the lounge and would say Hello and draw me into a two hour, mostly one sided conversation where I would nod and say &amp;ldquo;H-hah, sure, I guess the UN could be trying to control the population&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I was probably pretty stressed during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-to-keep-working&#34;&gt;Working to keep working&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With going into too much detail, I had the good fortune to work at one of New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s largest tech companies and at present, I work for one of the largest car companies. Ironic, given I don&amp;rsquo;t drive.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I relax enough. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if I know what that is exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;m not a robot and unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;m not a machine either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like playing videogames but I&amp;rsquo;d dropped off a lot since I started working. Last year, I even got annoyed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t game very much so I sold my gaming desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d double down on research and what not and try to do more productive things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably near enough the root of my troubles and why I&amp;rsquo;m writing it all down today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I still have that driving fear that I&amp;rsquo;ll be made redundant one day. I probably will and that&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s nowhere near strong enough as it was back then when it felt like a choice between life and death but it&amp;rsquo;s still enough to make me hesitate between reading a book and playing a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I overcorrected a lot. I like the idea that a to do list is better framed as a &amp;ldquo;things i could do&amp;rdquo; list since that sums it up nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to imagine side projects and then see them tower up. More and more until you realise you could never achieve these in your lifetime. The mere thought of them becomes exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully my blog isn&amp;rsquo;t quite like that. I have a couple of small goals buried somewhere but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad about not posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, I just imagine no one reads this anyway. I heard once from a reader which was really cool and sometimes I peek at analytics to see a lot of people seem to get value from &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/wsl2-vhd-issue/&#34;&gt;my Windows 10 VHD post&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond those technical things, I struggle to imagine anyone investing time into these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been meaning to write a post about my intentions with my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m still active and I have things on my list but mostly it feels like something driven by guilt and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A portfolio to say that I existed but not one with enough value to actually act as a portfolio!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intention going forward is to encourage myself to post a bit more often but with less lengthy content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that I find interesting and are worth sharing as well as a few larger, &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo; posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got one that I&amp;rsquo;m particularly excited to get struck into that&amp;rsquo;s a little quirky and is a bit of a fun investigation story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run into technical troubles from time to time and I&amp;rsquo;ll generally still share those but they don&amp;rsquo;t really come up often and admittedly, I don&amp;rsquo;t find them hugely interesting unless some sort of a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also changed the structure of the site a little bit. You can see any drafts at &lt;a href=&#34;https://next.utf9k.net&#34;&gt;next.utf9k.net&lt;/a&gt; and I manually merge things into the live branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that there&amp;rsquo;s a concept of &amp;ldquo;staging&amp;rdquo; where I can add things piecemeal, I might start managing longer posts as Github issues where I can make notes to myself and sort of &amp;ldquo;work out in the open&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean a story in the open is guaranteed to happen but adds a little bit more structure that might help with stories that are otherwise a bit overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tendency is to write them all in one sitting (like this post) with an optional review but it&amp;rsquo;s probably a bit healthier to piece things out and not potentially feel so overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;beyond-the-site&#34;&gt;Beyond the site&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this was just an excuse to shoe horn in some thoughts about this site into an otherwise fairly personal post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever really shied away from talking about my feelings very much so I don&amp;rsquo;t consider sharing this to be a huge effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, maybe there&amp;rsquo;s some value for other people in reading these sorts of things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure others can relate when I say I feel a bit paradoxical about a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the idea of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out&#34;&gt;FOMO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/business/against-hustle-culture-rise-and-grind-tgim.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hustle culture&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is stupid and unhealthy, yet at the same time I&amp;rsquo;ve clearly just described what is basically someone who struggles to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I have to do anything but at the same time, I get a bit itchy when I&amp;rsquo;m away from something constructive for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I would actually hate the idea of being retired on a beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to be retired with &lt;a href=&#34;https://howlongtobeat.com/user/Sentry&#34;&gt;my videogame backlog&lt;/a&gt; however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got some personal (and mental) struggles to deal with and perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll share some of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I gotta head off now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time, happy travels!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMO developers seem to have a tendency to be more open than most, probably because subscriptions from the fans directly keep them going rather than publisher deals.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my restricted license but my flat is quite literally on a main road so we don&amp;rsquo;t have any place to park.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>The CSS framework that could</description>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 20:48:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/has-bootstrap-eaten-the-world-yet/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To quote everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2012/10/03/inside-andreessen-horowitz-15-million-investment-in-rap-genius/?sh=7c7d895f4da2&#34;&gt;rap enthusiast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://a16z.com/author/marc-andreessen/&#34;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Software is eating the world&amp;rdquo; but I&amp;rsquo;d like to coin my own term in that vein: &amp;ldquo;Bootstrap is eating the world&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, perhaps it already has but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting seeing it pop up in real life from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few days, I remember seeing it styling the backend calendar system for the gym that I go to and also powering the patient search when I went to get a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are only two anecdotal instances of course but I wonder just how many systems are floating around the place that are plowing through work with that instantly recognisable basic Bootstrap template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My assumption is that it has continued to succeed because it still primarily caters to getting started as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://getbootstrap.com&#34;&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;, the two links for CSS and JS are right there for use straight out of the box. Similarly, they still distribute single static files too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like most CSS frameworks are only accessible via &lt;a href=&#34;https://npmjs.com&#34;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; with CDN-hosted stylesheets going the way of the dodo so it makes sense that people who choose bootstrap would stick with it. Lack of complexity is effectively a feature after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just imagine how much more productive the planet would be if we just doubled down on Bootstrap and threw away all of the other frontend tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For any readers who weren&amp;rsquo;t aware, &lt;a href=&#34;https://status.azure.com&#34;&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt; suffered from a &lt;a href=&#34;https://rcpmag.com/articles/2021/03/16/what-happened-azure-ad-outage.aspx&#34;&gt;major Azure Active Directory outage&lt;/a&gt; back in March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great deal of services were degraded while I was at work so I mostly spent March 15th, 2021 monitoring the situation and broadcasting status updates for fellow affected teams internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the updates were just synthesised from Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s various Twitter accounts which happened to be more up to date than the public status pages, but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the day, it got me wondering how widely Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s own services were affected by this outage. I mean, they dogfood their product offerings after all, right? Apparently Sales doesn&amp;rsquo;t, at least for any incoming enquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/&#34;&gt;marketing site for Azure Active Directory&lt;/a&gt;, you may notice a little &amp;ldquo;Chat with Sales&amp;rdquo; tab appear in the bottom right hand corner after all of the various scripts have loaded in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on that tab reveals an &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-services/&#34;&gt;Azure Chatbot&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;ll ask you which type of help you&amp;rsquo;d like and then you can select one of the follow categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I captured some footage following the dialogue path of these three options during the ongoing Azure AD outage so let&amp;rsquo;s see what happens when selecting each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;technical-support&#34;&gt;Technical Support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might imagine that this would be the most important option when it comes to resiliency during any major outages. Of course, if you&amp;rsquo;re an enterprise then you should really have an enterprise support plan but if you&amp;rsquo;re a startup or an indie, this might be well outside your budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;display: inherit; margin: 0 auto;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; controls&gt;
&lt;source preload src=&#34;01-technical.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
Ah, sorry! It looks like your browser either hates the h264 codec or it just doesn&#39;t support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you but it looked like nothing happened and our request just disappeared into the ether!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-support&#34;&gt;Business Support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now surely if a technical person can&amp;rsquo;t get through, business support is much more likely to make it. Nothing says importance like an executive with a credit card after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;display: inherit; margin: 0 auto;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; controls&gt;
&lt;source preload src=&#34;02-business.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
Ah, sorry! It looks like your browser either hates the h264 codec or it just doesn&#39;t support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No dice, basically the same exact outcome. I expected better! Pssh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sales&#34;&gt;Sales&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we know for sure that Sales isn&amp;rsquo;t going to work if the former two aren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any sane business, all attention should be directed towards supporting paying customers and alleviating any of their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;d be ridiculous to focus on some potentially unrealised future revenues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;display: inherit; margin: 0 auto;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; controls&gt;
&lt;source preload src=&#34;03-sales.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
Ah, sorry! It looks like your browser either hates the h264 codec or it just doesn&#39;t support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, perhaps I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-it-supposed-to-look-like&#34;&gt;What is it supposed to look like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually went through this same dialog flow, now two months down the track, and I was under the impression that all three options put you into a live call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that both Technical and Business Support options simply redirect you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/create-ticket/&#34;&gt;submit a support ticket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes sense but it also begs the question &amp;ldquo;How was this unavailable?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably the bot is querying for the support ticket URL in some backend every time you click on the button or something equally unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a quick poke around the acres of websocket events using the developer tools in my browser but there are like 5 events fired off just from clicking a button. It seemed like it was going to be a mess to dig through so I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there&amp;rsquo;s an old adage that&amp;rsquo;s probably relevant here. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know how it goes but basically, if you ever need to get a hold of someone at a company, just call the Sales department because they always pick up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dropbox is way too clingy</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/dropbox-is-way-too-clingy/</link>
      <description>A post in which I post about how involved the Dropbox cancellation process is.</description>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 18:50:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/dropbox-is-way-too-clingy/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As much as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; is great on a technical level, the user experience keeps degrading all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing it is a complete nightmare of clicking through super slow window transitions and banners begging you to upgrade your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I went through the process of deleting my account (again) out of frustration only to find that the already lengthy process had gotten even longer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through the deletion process as it stands in April 2021 and see how many clicks it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the file viewer area, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to click on your profile picture (&lt;strong&gt;First click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;01-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of the upper right corner of the Dropbox main view. The authors account is visible and the Settings button is highlighted.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the dropbown, click on Settings (&lt;strong&gt;Second click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;02-inside-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Dropbox account settings. There are a variety of radio buttons and tabs but the main item of interest is a link at the bottom titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;re inside the Settings menu, click on Delete account (&lt;strong&gt;Third click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be it&amp;hellip; right? Done. Simple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;03-first-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;A page asking the author if they would like to downgrade. It says that the author has to downgrade their account, that they&amp;amp;rsquo;ll lose a bunch of storage and lists some consequences such as &amp;amp;ldquo;Dropbox will stop syncing&amp;amp;rdquo;. At the bottom are two buttons, one in blue that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I changed my mind, take me back to Dropbox&amp;amp;rdquo; and one in white that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I still want to downgrade&amp;amp;rdquo;. The downgrade button is clearly what the user is after but the colour coding makes it tricky since the &amp;amp;ldquo;I don&amp;amp;rsquo;t want to cancel&amp;amp;rdquo; one is more prominent.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we really have to, I can handle putting up with one of these pages but come on, the colour coding of these buttons is clearly a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.darkpatterns.org/&#34;&gt;dark pattern&lt;/a&gt;. I clicked a button called &amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;rdquo; and now the primary action on this page is &amp;ldquo;I changed my mind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the wording that suggests I need to cancel my subscription is odd, in that deleting an account is surely the same act as cancelling a subscription.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Yes, I realise I&amp;rsquo;m not using this service I paid for. I don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, we resist the urge and click on &amp;ldquo;I still want to downgrade&amp;rdquo;, which weirdly does not say &amp;ldquo;Complete downgrade&amp;rdquo;. You know what that means&amp;hellip; (&lt;strong&gt;Fourth click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;04-second-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;A pop up modal asking if the author still wants to cancel. It has a bunch of radio buttons with reasons for cancellation, with the author having selected one that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I found another product I liked better&amp;amp;rdquo;. There is a button labelled &amp;amp;ldquo;Skip&amp;amp;rdquo; in the bottom left and two buttons on the bottom right. They read &amp;amp;ldquo;Don&amp;amp;rsquo;t cancel&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Continue cancelling&amp;amp;rdquo;. Strangely, &amp;amp;ldquo;Continue cancelling&amp;amp;rdquo; is the more prominent of the two, unlike the previous page.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God, yes! I&amp;rsquo;m two screens deep already so I&amp;rsquo;m pretty fucking sure I would like to cancel. I&amp;rsquo;m not &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; of leaving, I already decided that when you started degrading the UI. You could have just shipped nothing for the next 5 years and continued to make bank through word of mouth and the quality of your sync engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, even just the lock-in from existing applications already does most of the convincing for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting, the colour coding has switched once again to suggest that &amp;ldquo;Continue canceling&amp;rdquo; is now the primary action. Is this to trick me into not cancelling? I also didn&amp;rsquo;t notice that &amp;ldquo;Skip&amp;rdquo; option in the bottom left until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Fifth and sixth clicks&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;05-third-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;Another page with the title &amp;amp;ldquo;Dropbox Plus is so much more than just space&amp;amp;rdquo; and presents some alleged reasons to stay like &amp;amp;ldquo;Easy sharing&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Large storage volume&amp;amp;rdquo;. These are the same bullet points, roughly, as the earlier page. At the bottom are two buttons, a prominent blue one on the left titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Keep Dropbox Plus&amp;amp;rdquo; and a transparent, less obvious one on the right titled &amp;amp;ldquo;I still want to downgrade&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many fonts does Dropbox use? None of these screens are even consistent whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a problem with the product, I have a problem with the marketing department so none of this is helping. If anything, it has the opposite effect of making me want to cancel even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colour coding has changed yet again to suggest &amp;ldquo;Keep Dropbox Plus&amp;rdquo; is the primary action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Seventh click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;06-final-screen.png&#34; alt=&#34;Yet another page titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Before you go, Marcus&amp;amp;hellip;&amp;amp;rdquo;, addressed to the author. It has a large blue button in the middle of the screen that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;I changed my mind, take me back to Dropbox&amp;amp;rdquo;. There is another button for cancelling somewhere off screen that is not visible to the reader. The rest of the page just roughly lists the same claimed features as previous pages.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT DO YOU MEAN BEFORE I GO? THIS IS LITERALLY THE SAME INFORMATION PRESENTED FOR THE THIRD TIME. HOW IS THIS A CONVINCING ARGUMENT? I DON&amp;rsquo;T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU AREN&amp;rsquo;T EVEN TRYING.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t even see the cancel button on this page. You have to scroll right to the bottom (which I didn&amp;rsquo;t screenshot) and then click another cancel button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Eighth click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;07-done.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of a green banner that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;Account downgraded. Thanks for your feedback.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now originally, this is where I had ended the blog post but I actually went back to Dropbox a few weeks later&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and just discovered this process hadn&amp;rsquo;t even deleted my account. All I accomplished was that I downgraded my plan which is obvious in hindsight but also, why this much friction just to downgrade a plan then? Just what sort of nightmare will it take to delete my account and do businesses have to go through this hell if you purchase an enterprise plan?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;08-banner.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of a red banner that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;You are scheduled to downgrade.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s finish this thing off for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the home page, we once again click on the user profile and then on Settings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;01-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of the upper right corner of the Dropbox main view. The authors account is visible and the Settings button is highlighted.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Ninth and tenth clicks&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once more, hit the &amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;rdquo; button at the bottom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;02-inside-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Dropbox account settings. There are a variety of radio buttons and tabs but the main item of interest is a link at the bottom titled &amp;amp;ldquo;Delete account&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Eleventh click&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;09-delete.png&#34; alt=&#34;A form that says &amp;amp;ldquo;Permanently delete your Dropbox account&amp;amp;rdquo; with three inputs: one for your password, one for your reason for leaving and a third to enter in more details.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; more clicks to fill in this shitty form and that brings us up to &lt;strong&gt;seventeen clicks&lt;/strong&gt; when I hit &amp;ldquo;Permanently delete&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;10-free.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tightly cropped screenshot of a black banner that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;Your account has been deleted. We&amp;amp;rsquo;re sorry to see you go.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No company that did this sort of shit ever made me feel excited or even curious about coming back. To this day, I have never resubscribed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com&#34;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; purely because their cancellation policy requires you to ring a human person in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would anyone do this sort of thing? It just screams disbelief in your own product. If you&amp;rsquo;re so scared of people leaving, it makes me wonder just what kind of mess you&amp;rsquo;re hiding under the rug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there&amp;rsquo;s only one thing I have to say to Dropbox after all this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HhnUK1YmMEU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently not as I later found out.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By which I mean, just now.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once on the password field, a second on a popup to autofill from my password manager, a third to open the &amp;ldquo;Reasons for leaving&amp;rdquo; dropdown, a fourth to select a reason, a fifth to start entering &amp;ldquo;More details&amp;rdquo; and the sixth is when I hit &amp;ldquo;Permanently delete&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Starbucks Rewards or: Whether a Coffee Shop Can Be a Third Place</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/starbucks-rewards-third-place/</link>
      <description>A post in which I ramble about Starbucks and how if you squint, it&#39;s a place that some people treat as their second home.</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 13:21:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/starbucks-rewards-third-place/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like all non-technical blog posts I write, the ones that get published are often a spur of the moment reaction to something I just saw or experienced. In this case, I was visiting a Starbucks location here in New Zealand and learned an annoying qualifier about the recently introduced Starbucks Rewards system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any international readers, Starbucks doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a huge presence here in New Zealand. As of 2018, the total number of stores had dropped from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/106769552/restaurant-brands-sells-starbucks-coffee-in-nz&#34;&gt;nearly 50 to 22&lt;/a&gt; with a majority of those being within key cities such as Auckland and Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly a coffee connoisseur, I do know that they&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to carve out a portion of the market due to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.is/pXeER&#34;&gt;strong coffee culture&lt;/a&gt; both here and across the ocean in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the sale of Starbucks from Restaurant Brands to Tahua Partners, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://heartofthecity.co.nz/dining/coffee/starbucks-coffee&#34;&gt;recent renovation of their flagship Queen Street store&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in as I write this, it seems that they&amp;rsquo;ve started taking a different course than the prior owners who just sort of had it plodding along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the outside, it seems that they&amp;rsquo;re attempting to take the high ground by giving off a premium, polished appearance rather than the budget, store-on-every-corner approach that found huge success in America. Most of my evidence of this is purely anecdotal in the form of &amp;ldquo;Well, all of the new stores look fancy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;There seems to be a focus on giving the feeling and illusion of space, even if factually, that isn&amp;rsquo;t true&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the actual app rewards ecosystem, let&amp;rsquo;s first take a bit of a detour into psychology and something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write about for quite some time: the concept of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place&#34;&gt;third place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short version is that in community building theory, there are concepts of &amp;ldquo;places&amp;rdquo;, with the &amp;ldquo;first place&amp;rdquo; being your home and the &amp;ldquo;second place&amp;rdquo; being your workplace. In his probably seminal&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4119.The_Great_Good_Place&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Great Good Place&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, Ray Oldenburg talks about the idea of a &amp;ldquo;third place&amp;rdquo;, which compliments the first and second, and aids in the feeling of having a connection to society and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I won&amp;rsquo;t go into it too much, nor am I particularly qualified to, there are a few key characteristics that you may or may not recognise in any number of places you go to such as coffee shops, libraries, bookstores, parks, churches and all sorts of non-work, communal settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A condensed version of those characteristics is roughly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It should be neutral&lt;/strong&gt;: No one is required to be there for any reason. You can come and go as you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status should not matter&lt;/strong&gt;: Whether you&amp;rsquo;re an executive or a retail assistant, you get the same treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The main activity is conversation&lt;/strong&gt;: Assuming you&amp;rsquo;re with friends or feel comfortable meeting strangers, the primary activity you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing is talking. Starbucks has a bit of an asterisk here as people also come to work in a solo capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There tend to be regulars&lt;/strong&gt;: The presence of regulars sets the tone and their presence also attracts newcomers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The location has a low profile&lt;/strong&gt;: It never feels intentionally pretentious or exclusive to any particular section of society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It has a light tone&lt;/strong&gt;: There&amp;rsquo;s never a sense of tension or extreme seriousness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It feels like a second home&lt;/strong&gt;: You feel like you belong, or perhaps more accurately, like you&amp;rsquo;re not unwanted given it is a business after all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&amp;rsquo;ve also forgotten what I was writing about in the first place but this is a long winded way of saying that I consider Starbucks to be a third place for some, whether they realise it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a teenager, nor do I really know what teenagers in the city do in their downtime, but it seems like young people definitely do come to places like this to hang out and so it seems to fit the criteria of a third place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For myself even, when I think of a place to come and work on my site, which is neither my job nor an aspect of my home, usually cafes with space tend to be a place to go. It started as a bit of a gag after seeing people with Macbooks in Starbucks but now I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people to some extent although I like to think without the pretentiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, but anyway, back to our main thread. Starbucks recently introduced their global &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.starbucks.co.nz/rewards&#34;&gt;rewards system&lt;/a&gt; to New Zealand. It&amp;rsquo;s a system where you have a virtual card and you can load it up with money. If you install one of the mobile apps, you can pull up your barcode on screen, scan it and collect rewards points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a good system, in that for Starbucks as a business, it establishes a sense of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out&#34;&gt;FOMO&lt;/a&gt;. If you don&amp;rsquo;t pay using the in-app virtual card, you can&amp;rsquo;t actually collect any points as I found out this morning. Given that, it allows Starbucks to compete for your attention outside of the bounds of its store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an element of lock-in, where you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother visiting other stores because the money you&amp;rsquo;ve already loaded onto your card is useless outside of it. That isn&amp;rsquo;t any different than other customer rewards system I&amp;rsquo;m sure, although you generally can&amp;rsquo;t pay for videogames or clothing in-store, via an app. At the risk of stating the obvious, there&amp;rsquo;s no particular reason for me to go to one store or another since there&amp;rsquo;s no differentiator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a double-lock in that while an asset is an asset, whether it&amp;rsquo;s $20 in cash or $20 on a transport card, having $20 on a Starbucks card feels like a waste of money if you have it sitting there and you go somewhere else for coffee. I don&amp;rsquo;t really think I get that feeling with transport because there aren&amp;rsquo;t really any reasonable alternatives. A bus can&amp;rsquo;t really compete with an Uber when it comes to speed but, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t particular care like myself, all coffee seems mostly interchangeable. I also wouldn&amp;rsquo;t come to Starbucks for coffee, if I cared about coffee that much I imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, I was going to make some comparisons to how this could evolve into a consumer hell if everyone starts to follow this model but the more I think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s not really a sensible forecasting of the future so I&amp;rsquo;m simply just not going to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also going to say that it&amp;rsquo;s a horrible rewards system compared to the original &amp;ldquo;Get 9 stamps and your 10th visit gets you a free coffee&amp;rdquo; but after doing the numbers ($1 = 2 points), $250 gets you to gold status. If you visit Starbucks frequently, that actually not too bad of a deal compared to something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uber.com/nz/en/u/rewards/&#34;&gt;Uber Rewards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I particularly achieved any meaningful insight with this whole thing other than &amp;ldquo;The third place is a thing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Some people probably feel that Starbucks is a third place&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if mobile app ecosystems make me feel better or worse about a third place&amp;rdquo; but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter since it&amp;rsquo;s a business and I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know or interact with anyone who works here in the first place&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably would be a third place if I came here with friends, but I don&amp;rsquo;t, so until then it&amp;rsquo;s just a convenient store that happens to have enough space to function as a work area (in which typing on my laptop is work) without the premium that comes with having to pay for a co-working space. The &amp;ldquo;co&amp;rdquo; part of co-working space is what I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly want anyway. It&amp;rsquo;s just nice being able to blend in and not having to feel like you should be networking or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it really is a third place then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of the idea of a &amp;ldquo;third place&amp;rdquo; for a few years now, I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually read any literature on it besides Wikipedia. In this case, it just seems nice to cite a source even though I&amp;rsquo;m writing this off the cuff. Something something professionalism.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pun intended&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>Honestly, this post is weird and dumb. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.</description>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a person who lives in my general area that I&amp;rsquo;ve spotted two or three times in the almost three years that I have lived at my flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has a book open and reads it, while walking and for the most part, seemingly not paying any attention to where he is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels entirely ridiculous and comical so it&amp;rsquo;s definitely noticeable whenever I do spot him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That behaviour is something I think I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before at school where you would have that one kid seemingly glued to a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How that knowledge is used is beyond me since they never seem to do much else besides reading but that&amp;rsquo;s besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ridiculous as their actions seem, we&amp;rsquo;re effectively all that person now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime we get the urge to see what new chat message has arrived or whip out a device to flick through a music playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really just the same behaviour but without the persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably never learned anything from quickly skimming my &amp;ldquo;Liked Songs&amp;rdquo; on Spotify while waiting for a traffic light though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Address book sorting</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/address-book-sorting/</link>
      <description>The macOS and iOS address book leaves a bit to be desired</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 22:48:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/address-book-sorting/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I boot up an Apple device for the first time, it always strikes me as annoying to find that the address book is sorted by last name first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about this further, I think the frustration stems from my being more unfamiliar with last names than first. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I don&amp;rsquo;t know their last names either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a lookup issue in the sense that I have to visualise the full name of a person and then break off the end chunk and put it first. That is, in a sense that&amp;rsquo;s what my brain is doing rather than jumping straight to their first name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do wonder if last names are less commonly used? For example, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time I ever referred to someone by their last name ie Ms. Blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would partly chalk that up to a mix of my age, tendency to hate overly formal things and my general professional which is&amp;hellip; not traditionally professional shall we say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, I tend to think of people by their first names and I always dig out that setting and turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be that it&amp;rsquo;s more the realm of business people, who have more formal connections (and business cards) than I do. For that reason, it might be that they don&amp;rsquo;t tend to use first names as prominently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could google search it, and I will, but before then it makes me wonder how many other default settings are considered weird to other people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autocorrection is another one where I find that I need to toggle off all the assistance features or I&amp;rsquo;ll be driven mad. I prefer my screen real estate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s a committee of address book creators too, who uphold the guidelines of what makes a good address book. I&amp;rsquo;m just speculating at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to know what other default settings bug you! You can let me know through the variety of different mediums in the footer below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FAQ driven configuration</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/faq-driven-configuration/</link>
      <description>Not sure how to structure a config file? Try answering questions rather than trying to come up with categories</description>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 18:14:00 +1300</pubDate>

      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/faq-driven-configuration/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure this idea isn&amp;rsquo;t new in the slightest but a handy trick I&amp;rsquo;ve been using is to define configuration as a series of questions, not unlike a FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than explain it, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/dotfiles/blob/62813e09dc6d5127b0f25a5017ae23fd37ce180f/doom/.doom.d/config.org&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a configuration file I&amp;rsquo;ve structured this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a little light on detail because I&amp;rsquo;ve been too lazy to flesh it out with extra context, but even in spite of that I think it&amp;rsquo;s easier to navigate thanks to the structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-simple-example&#34;&gt;A simple example&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at one of those blocks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-emacs&#34; data-lang=&#34;emacs&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;***&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;would&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;see&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;inside&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Displaying&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;seems&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;idea&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;display-time-mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp&#34;&gt;elisp&lt;/a&gt; syntax going on here. The actual code used is besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we set up a question. It&amp;rsquo;s well scoped to asking just one thing: &amp;ldquo;How can we see the time while inside Emacs?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, &lt;code&gt;(display-time-mode 1)&lt;/code&gt;, is pretty short in this case but it could span multiple lines. Regardless, we can safely assume that there isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be some configuration related to checking email tucked away in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-slightly-more-complex-example&#34;&gt;A slightly more complex example&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/dotfiles&#34;&gt;my own dotfiles&lt;/a&gt; are a complete mess at the best of times but thankfully that means I have some examples of how this tip can be used to add some more structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/dotfiles/blob/f14b4ebf86e41fa9cad3630355364eada11482f1/doom/.doom.d/config.org#setting-org-file-locations&#34;&gt;an older version&lt;/a&gt; of my Doom Emacs configuration. I only pick Emacs because most of my other dotfiles aren&amp;rsquo;t very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can distill the linked section down to something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-emacs&#34; data-lang=&#34;emacs&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;***&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Setting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;locations&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;after!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-agenda-files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-agenda-directory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;inbox.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-agenda-directory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;gtd.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-agenda-directory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;tickler.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;dropbox-cal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;events.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;dropbox-cal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;events-inbox.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;))))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;after!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-archive-location&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-agenda-directory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;archive/archive-&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;format-time-string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;%Y%m&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;current-time&lt;/span&gt;))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;.org::&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve reduced the indentation a little for pure readability within this blog post but having &amp;ldquo;archive/archive-&amp;rdquo; on a new line may or may not be valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here we have a generic section called &amp;ldquo;Setting org file locations&amp;rdquo;. Is that telling Emacs to set or create files in those locations? What does the second block have to do with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this works, the block is quite expansive (not helped by my excessive wall of text) and at first glance, it&amp;rsquo;s not hugely clear if both of these blocks are needed. In reality, only the first one is actually &amp;ldquo;Setting org file locations&amp;rdquo; and even then, it isn&amp;rsquo;t setting anything so much as determining where to look for files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/dotfiles/blob/6b6763a385b842b9dbdc3c883fe8bd0f13df60f2/doom/.doom.d/config.org#setting-up&#34;&gt;a later version&lt;/a&gt; of the same file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the configuration has changed a bit, I&amp;rsquo;ll be reducing it to just the blocks we see above for a side by side comparison&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-emacs&#34; data-lang=&#34;emacs&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Setting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;***&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;live?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;after!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-agenda-files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-agenda-directory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;inbox.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-agenda-directory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;gtd.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-agenda-directory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;tickler.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;dropbox-cal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;events.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;dropbox-cal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;events-inbox.org&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;))))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;***&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;What&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;shall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;completed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;tasks?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;after!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-archive-location&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;org-agenda-directory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;archive/archive-&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;format-time-string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;%Y%m&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b&#34;&gt;current-time&lt;/span&gt;))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;.org::&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we have exactly the same configuration, but split into two separate questions. While the actual &amp;ldquo;answers&amp;rdquo; may not be parseable at first glance for anyone unaffiliated with Emacs, the questions (or heading) give a nice, concise English description of what&amp;rsquo;s going on here, without actually telling you anything about the code specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also a lot easier, in my opinion, to visually parse as the blocks are split up into nice, small sections and they lend themselves better to navigating via a table of contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;defending-your-configuration-through-time&#34;&gt;Defending your configuration through time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of my favourite aspects, which I only got to experience just recently, is that posing your configuration as a series of questions means that changing the &amp;ldquo;answers&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t specifically mean you have to restructure your configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at an example of how you might normally specify a configuration section. In this case, we&amp;rsquo;re setting an environment variable that points to a Dropbox folder.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-emacs&#34; data-lang=&#34;emacs&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Setting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;up&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;dropbox&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;DROPBOX_DIR&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s say we get fed up with Dropbox and decide to move entirely to our own WebDav server. Here&amp;rsquo;s how much we might naively change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-diff&#34; data-lang=&#34;diff&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f55&#34;&gt;-** Setting up Dropbox
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f55&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;+** Setting up WebDav
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f55&#34;&gt;-(setq dropbox (getenv &amp;#34;DROPBOX_DIR&amp;#34;))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f55&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;+(setq webdav (getenv &amp;#34;WEBDAV_DIR&amp;#34;))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve probably done this many times, as I move around software. For a little while, my Emacs configuration has been scoped nicer to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-emacs&#34; data-lang=&#34;emacs&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;files?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;storage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;~/Dropbox&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and when it came time to make some changes, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to touch my original &amp;ldquo;question&amp;rdquo; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-diff&#34; data-lang=&#34;diff&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;** Where do I store my files?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f55&#34;&gt;-(setq storage &amp;#34;~/Dropbox&amp;#34;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f55&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#50fa7b;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;+(setq storage &amp;#34;~/SomewhereElse&amp;#34;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really no different than the principles of encapsulation and what not and I&amp;rsquo;ve found it really handy to keep in mind over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;structuring-your-configuration&#34;&gt;Structuring your configuration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps above all, I&amp;rsquo;ve just found that it reduces the amount of effort I have to put into configuration mentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could easily dump it all into one file without trouble but that just becomes a tangled nest over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opposite end of the scale, I used to aspire to provide a lengthy detailed explainer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html&#34;&gt;in the vein of Tecosaur&lt;/a&gt;, only to struggle to come up with well scoped sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s too easy to let the flag for &amp;ldquo;Following symlinks&amp;rdquo; live in the same section as the actual config for &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s where my files live&amp;rdquo; because they&amp;rsquo;re sorta related but also one has a wider scope of effect than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this method is there&amp;rsquo;s no thinking at all. You often quickly realise whether something is bleeding outside of the scope of the configuration and so perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time to pose a new question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That and it&amp;rsquo;s just less mentally taxing to read in my opinion. With a nicely formed, FAQ style configuration file,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-this-strictly-scoped-to-literate-configuration&#34;&gt;Is this strictly scoped to literate configuration?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not at all! While I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/&#34;&gt;org-mode&lt;/a&gt; for literate configuration, despite my &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/emacs-probably-isnt-right-for-me/&#34;&gt;recent struggles with its parent&lt;/a&gt;, you can achieve this with presumably any configuration files that support comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I infrequently touch most of my dotfiles, I took a crack at converting my small &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/neovim/neovim&#34;&gt;neovim&lt;/a&gt; configuration to follow this style, as viewable &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/dotfiles/blob/37840b8/nvim/.config/nvim/init.vim&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone still relatively new, I actually find it handy given I&amp;rsquo;ve long forgotten what lives in there and most of it looks like gibberish to me at this point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;one-extra-hypothetical-benefit&#34;&gt;One extra, hypothetical benefit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unintended consequence of this layout, which may be a stretch to claim as I haven&amp;rsquo;t made use of it myself, is that it can potentially lend itself quite well to search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;search.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of Github code search. The author has typed &amp;amp;ldquo;what is listening on a port&amp;amp;rdquo; into the code search against their dotfiles and found a matching file. The match isn&amp;amp;rsquo;t exactly what they typed in but close enough as if to suggest that searching for questions you&amp;amp;rsquo;ve previously answered may be easier with this method.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, I remembered the essence of the question, but not the specific wording of the question itself. Likewise, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t remember to search for &lt;code&gt;lsof&lt;/code&gt; so in this entirely staged example, there is possibly potential for having an easier time searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At worst, the structure makes for an easier time parsing when you want to answer someone&amp;rsquo;s question by linking them a pseudo-question answer session that lives within your configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hello@utf9k.net&#34;&gt;Let me know&lt;/a&gt; if you end up making use of it, or if you already do! I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to move more of my setup into sometihng similar so perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll do a status report down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often do this as Dropbox might live at &lt;code&gt;~/marcus/Dropbox&lt;/code&gt; on one computer while living at &lt;code&gt;/mnt/c/Users/marcus/Dropbox&lt;/code&gt; on another. The latter would be if I wanted to access my Dropbox from within &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about&#34;&gt;WSL&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>My confessions as a tooling alcoholic</description>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 17:41:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/emacs-probably-isnt-right-for-me/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not someone who tends to wear my text editor on my sleeve, probably because I don&amp;rsquo;t stick to just one anyway, but I&amp;rsquo;ve probably mentioned Emacs more than most in the last year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out using it as a little bit of a joke more than anything and found myself pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;org-mode&#34;&gt;org-mode&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;org-mode&lt;/code&gt; is always touted as a massive powerhouse, and having gone down the GTD rabbit hole and all that, it honestly is one of the most feature packed utilities you can find. Everything from basic tagging up to fully fledged time tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general outliner tool as well, it&amp;rsquo;s really nice being able to nest items without any end in sight and even link to headings within other files too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;org-agenda&#34;&gt;org-agenda&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;code&gt;org-mode&lt;/code&gt; lets you sprinkle &lt;code&gt;TODO&lt;/code&gt; headings throughout your files, you still need some way to see an overview. Being able to hit a few keys and see a fully customisable pseudo-dashboard with upcoming tasks, appointments and even habit tracking is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;literate-programming&#34;&gt;Literate programming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this isn&amp;rsquo;t strictly the domain of Emacs, &lt;code&gt;org-mode&lt;/code&gt; makes it really easy to define blocks of code within a file and put commentary around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html&#34;&gt;Tecosaur&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Emacs configuration is perhaps a prime example of what you can achieve. To be clear, that website and his dotfiles are one in the same. The code you see on that webpage &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; his configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the strongest selling point for me. My Emacs configuration lives as a &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt; file, which is &amp;ldquo;tangled&amp;rdquo; (transformed) into a proper configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;community&#34;&gt;Community&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not someone who considers myself part of many communities at all but I can definitely say that the parts of the Emacs community I checked out were definitely quite welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I was constantly surprised at the work that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs&#34;&gt;Henrik Lissner&lt;/a&gt; churns out seemingly every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His issue responses are not only carefully considered, but also light and humourous too. That extends to even his commit messages which users may never come across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually crossed paths briefly a few years ago and while I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it at the time, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sanityinc&#34;&gt;Steve Purcell&lt;/a&gt; would appear all over the Emacs ecosystem too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise his involvement only to discover that he not only is a huge contributor but even has a large hand in running &lt;a href=&#34;https://melpa.org/#/&#34;&gt;MELPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, because my list isn&amp;rsquo;t very long and I never really engaged in the community for the most part, I learned a bunch from trawling through the repos of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jethrokuan&#34;&gt;Jethro Kuan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tecosaur/&#34;&gt;Tecosaur&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lowlights&#34;&gt;Lowlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tooling-alcoholism&#34;&gt;Tooling Alcoholism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a term that I &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/dIjKJjzRX_E?t=82&#34;&gt;first heard mentioned&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago by &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.me/mpj&#34;&gt;mpj&lt;/a&gt; and it basically holds true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs, for me, is essentially the definition of tooling alcoholism because I can happily spend hours configuring it without actually achieving much at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this extends to tools like &lt;code&gt;org-agenda&lt;/code&gt; too. There&amp;rsquo;s a temptation to have Emacs do it all and so I end up breaking my existing systems just to make them fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take calendars as an example. I tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dengste/org-caldav&#34;&gt;org-caldav&lt;/a&gt;, which was kind of slow and some of the state got a little out of sync. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really figure out how to invoke the required keys to delete everything so I nuked the state files and it broke. At my old job, I also tried to make that interop nicely with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/myuhe/org-gcal.el&#34;&gt;org-gcal&lt;/a&gt; which worked nicely but I don&amp;rsquo;t use Google Calendar for my personal calendar. I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ndw/org-mac-iCal&#34;&gt;org-mac-iCal&lt;/a&gt; which worked the best of the lot (no blocking sync required but refreshes can be a little slow) but I had to dig out a specific &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terjesannum/org-mac-iCal&#34;&gt;fork&lt;/a&gt; that removed version checks because macOS was never expected to go past &lt;code&gt;10.x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, all this is to say, I started reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545&#34;&gt;RFC5545&lt;/a&gt; and thinking about how this could be made a much better process before realising that I actually don&amp;rsquo;t care about calendars and being able to assign snippets to text to my calendar entries is not at all worth this amount of pseudo work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think calendaring was probably the most extreme variation but the tweaking is never ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mobile-support&#34;&gt;Mobile support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to using Emacs on mobile devices, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a variety of applications and I think I&amp;rsquo;d say &lt;a href=&#34;https://beorgapp.com/&#34;&gt;beOrg&lt;/a&gt; for iOS and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android&#34;&gt;Orgzly&lt;/a&gt; for Android are definitely the nicest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, depending on what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, some of the more niche settings in org may not be supported or require further configuration. One of the main selling points of beOrg is that it supports an entire Scheme interpreter but at this point, I&amp;rsquo;m about to black out from the aforementioned tooling alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should mention though that these are both TODO applications effectively. While Orgzly, from memory, leans more towards outline editing than beOrg does, I still got the feeling that they aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily designed to be considered as &amp;ldquo;note taking&amp;rdquo; apps, in so much as an outline is effectively a bunch of inlined notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;now-what&#34;&gt;Now what?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could probably write a whole lot more about Emacs, in the relatively brief time I used it, but for now, this is probably enough of what is effectively a farewell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a break for a couple of months last year and started missing some of the org functionality. I got back into it only to go down the rabbit hole again and honestly, none of it was particularly productive at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s too easy to daydream about all the stuff you could do, without really asking if you should do it. Even before then, odds are you might never get to that state at all when you find yourself fumbling around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some troubles might be due to looking at things with the wrong mental model of course but acknowledging that still doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help me make everything as seamless as it could (or arguably should) be in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to stick with basic markdown and a text editor for my notes and see how it goes. Besides, I&amp;rsquo;m meant to be keeping these sorts of things &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/zettelkasten-blog-a-good-idea/&#34;&gt;on my blog&lt;/a&gt; anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google recently surfaced awful results for movies and tv</title>

      <description>How many widgets can you fit on a mobile webpage? More than should be legal</description>

      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/a-recently-horrible-iteration-of-google-search/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you but whenever I have just watched a movie, or tv series, I like to look it up on Wikipedia to read about the development behind the scenes and how it was received upon release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I also have a pretty bad habit of reading the plot of a film while I&amp;rsquo;m also meant to be watching the film itself. Never in theatres of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally finished watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos&#34;&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/a&gt; in early December last year and had gone to check out the Wikipedia page for the series. Much to my surprise, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t actually find it when doing a basic Google search for &amp;ldquo;The Sopranos&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should note that Google have changed their search results since I captured the following recordings.&lt;/strong&gt; As such, they no longer reflect what you receive when doing a query for &amp;ldquo;The Sopranos&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of the same elements appear but they have been sprinkled throughout the results rather than all stacked at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Wikipedia is clearly visible at the top of the page as the first result making my original complaint outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, the fact that someone at Google signed off on what was, until quite recently, a hideous, bloated layout doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly inspire confidence in the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just happen to have taken a screen recording of this mess which was live at least as recently as early December and so that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;d like to present to you now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;display: inherit; margin: 0 auto;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; controls&gt;
&lt;source preload src=&#34;google-search-the-sopranos.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
Ah, sorry! It looks like your browser either hates the h264 codec or it just doesn&#39;t support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is all this?! There&amp;rsquo;s so much going on visually here. We&amp;rsquo;ve got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some tabs to see cast photos, episode listings and other bits and pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A carousel of posters from the show&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sort of watch list/show tracker functionality? I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually seen a UI so I wonder where your list is saved to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A scoring round up which I assume is strictly critic scores. Is it a roundup of every score over the last 20 plus years? I assume so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An arbitrary block telling me that 89% of Google users liked the show. 89% of&amp;hellip; people who clicked thumbs up when doing a Google search for the show? Can anyone just randomly vote?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview which reminds me of Wikipedia. Hey, speaking of, it&amp;rsquo;s still nowhere to be seen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another carousel showing the cast. Wait, what were those earlier tabs for then if I don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now we&amp;rsquo;re actually at the search results and&amp;hellip; oh wait, not quite yet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shows other people searched for. Cool but I searched &amp;ldquo;The Sopranos&amp;rdquo;, not &amp;ldquo;Shows like The Sopranos&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some questions (who are these even from?) such as &amp;ldquo;Is it worth watching&amp;rdquo; (yes) and &amp;ldquo;Is there a Season 7&amp;rdquo; (no)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode listings. Always good to start from the last episode so I can get potentially spoiled on how characters develop. I know it probably has nothing to do with Google but the appearance of the words &amp;ldquo;FREE HBO&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;HD&amp;rdquo; feel really tacky. Even pirate sites have a little more taste in their naming schema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet another carousel with videos. Great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now we&amp;rsquo;re at the search results and you know what? The rest of it is all just crap I don&amp;rsquo;t care about. All it has is derivative content like pop culture articles, streaming links and &amp;ldquo;related crime TV shows&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s great and all but I want to find out more &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the show hence the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I just gave up and tacked &amp;ldquo;Wikipedia&amp;rdquo; on to the end of my query and got what I was after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand though. Is this what the data showed that users were craving? I struggle to believe that a human signed off on this. It&amp;rsquo;s like someone took a machine learning algorithm and set &amp;ldquo;How much metadata would you like?&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, here is what the equivalent search in &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckduckgo.com&#34;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; looked like on that same day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;display: inherit; margin: 0 auto;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; controls&gt;
&lt;source preload src=&#34;ddg-search-the-sopranos.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
Ah, sorry! It looks like your browser either hates the h264 codec or it just doesn&#39;t support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was that much easier, it actually inlined a bunch of links you might want to look at, rather than unrolling them for you into a massive information dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also trying out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecosia.org&#34;&gt;Ecosia&lt;/a&gt; at the time too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;display: inherit; margin: 0 auto;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; controls&gt;
&lt;source preload src=&#34;ecosia-search-the-sopranos.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
Ah, sorry! It looks like your browser either hates the h264 codec or it just doesn&#39;t support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Ecosia uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://bing.com&#34;&gt;Bing&lt;/a&gt; under the hood but it also surfaces Wikipedia as the first result without any troubles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I should also point out that the Google search result was only ever served on mobile by the way. Performing the same query on desktop just shows Wikipedia as the first result like you might expect. Thankfully those card style widgets seem to be entirely quarantined to mobile as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, I hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using a blog like a zettelkasten seems like a good idea</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/zettelkasten-blog-a-good-idea/</link>
      <description>I mean, it&#39;s what it says on the tin!</description>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 17:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/zettelkasten-blog-a-good-idea/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having recently gotten back into the swing of reading via &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&#34;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, I spotted a post from &lt;a href=&#34;https://critter.blog&#34;&gt;Mike Crittenden&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&#34;https://critter.blog/2021/02/10/blogging-as-a-zettelkasten/&#34;&gt;Blogging as a Zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It touches on the idea that a blog can act as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/&#34;&gt;zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt;. For the unfamiliar, a zettelkasten is nothing more than a big collection of notes. While you might imagine reams of snippets dumped into a tool like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)&#34;&gt;Apple Notes&lt;/a&gt;, the difference is that each note (or &amp;ldquo;zettel&amp;rdquo;) is generously interlinked with other notes so as to form a &amp;ldquo;web of knowledge&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;second brain&amp;rdquo;. Each note should address one standalone idea such as &amp;ldquo;English is an unproductive language&amp;rdquo; rather than a more generic &amp;ldquo;Notes on languages&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very blog post &lt;a href=&#34;https://critter.blog/2021/02/10/blogging-as-a-zettelkasten/&#34;&gt;I just linked&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of what a zettelkasten note would look like. There are a number of hyperlinks scattered about and rather than reiterate previous ideas, you can just link to prior knowledge that has been expanded in detail elsewhere, should the reader choose to follow.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As time goes on, themes start to appear, not unlike one of those crazy pinboards you see detectives use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that new insights should just sort of &amp;ldquo;fall out&amp;rdquo; by putting ideas in close proximity where your brain can make all the connections it likes. Your brain already works this way for the most part, like when you have a eureka moment in the shower, and so the idea is to basically make that process as easy as possible. While most examples seem to have degenerated into YouTube productivity clickbait, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvWic15iXjk&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How to Use Roam to Outline a New Article in Under 20 Minutes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is still a golden example of what this process looks like. That was probably the single most thing that made me raise an eyebrow in interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now then, while I&amp;rsquo;ve already generated enough content for a &amp;ldquo;What I don&amp;rsquo;t like about zettelkasten software&amp;rdquo; type post later on, this post is best kept succinct and in line with the title so let&amp;rsquo;s touch briefly on why I think using a blog as a zettelkasten seems like a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-longevity&#34;&gt;1) Longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main issue that should concern anyone semi-serious about zettel software is that you&amp;rsquo;re inherently dealing with information that may be retained for quite some time, if not possibly an entire lifetime. In the grand scheme of things, software itself is not a very old medium and yet, it feels like &lt;a href=&#34;https://snyk.io/blog/how-much-do-we-really-know-about-how-packages-behave-on-the-npm-registry/&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; ecosystems tend to degrade within mere months, if not years.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of just using a blog, and particularly a static site backed by any text-based format, is that it&amp;hellip; I was going to say that it &lt;a href=&#34;https://brandur.org/fragments/graceful-degradation-time&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;degrades gracefully through time&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; only to realise that humans are incapable of original thought and there is no such thing as free will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also can&amp;rsquo;t help but notice that a lot of the attempts in this space are from relatively fresh startups, rather than long-term established companies. Not that either is necessarily more equipped but the idea that &lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com&#34;&gt;Roam Research&lt;/a&gt; has raised &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/a-200-million-seed-valuation-for-roam-shows-investor-frenzy-for-note-taking-apps&#34;&gt;$200 million&lt;/a&gt; in funding, as opposed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082814/companies-succeeded-bootstrapping.asp&#34;&gt;bootstrapping&lt;/a&gt;, is absolutely horrifying to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, I&amp;rsquo;m sure users are happy that Roam has the cash to make the app nice and crisp but the idea that you would entrust any amount of long term knowledge storage to a business that will inevitably be ripped apart by venture capitalists in 5 years when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t turn on a profit on &amp;ldquo;Joe Schmo&amp;rsquo;s 40,000 hyperlink sprawl regarding &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper&#34;&gt;himalayan pinecones&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly comforting.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-one-system-to-rule-them-all&#34;&gt;2) One System To Rule Them All&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to have just one way of doing things is often not ideal because you&amp;rsquo;re probably forcing unrelated things into one box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case though, I find having multiple systems for writing is annoying. Blog posts are just text and &amp;ldquo;zettels&amp;rdquo; are just text so why not have one workflow for dealing with both. It may be that different software is required (whether web-based or desktop software) or even a unique plain text format such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org&#34;&gt;org-mode&lt;/a&gt; in the case of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.orgroam.com&#34;&gt;org-roam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less software is always nice, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-reliability&#34;&gt;3) Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s one piece of &amp;ldquo;zettel&amp;rdquo; software &lt;a href=&#34;https://logseq.com&#34;&gt;in particular&lt;/a&gt; that comes to mind where I fumbled some magical formatting code in the web editor and destroyed a post beyond recognition. While it was backed by Git, everything autosaves so I had to do some unwiring. I actually chalk it up to user error but if I can&amp;rsquo;t trust myself to not break the software (as has happened twice), then perhaps the UX unavoidably has to be called into question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also remember Roam Research used to suffer from some site troubles back in the early days. It isn&amp;rsquo;t hugely comforting knowing that your knowledge might be inaccessible whether it be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~lucia/courses/2131-02/A2/trythemsource.txt&#34;&gt;on a train or in a car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-its-hidden-in-plain-sight-a-secret-rant&#34;&gt;4) It&amp;rsquo;s hidden in plain sight (a secret rant)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of me has come to associate &amp;ldquo;zettelkasten&amp;rdquo; with the whole &amp;ldquo;Productivity Porn&amp;rdquo; movement. The idea is nice but the wider fanbase often gives me pause. To be clear though, I think a lot of that ecosystem floats around YouTube and Reddit rather than say, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam&#34;&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://jethro.dev&#34;&gt;Jethro Kuan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Introduction.html#Introduction&#34;&gt;elisp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.orgroam.com&#34;&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, who the hell is &lt;a href=&#34;https://fortelabs.co/&#34;&gt;Tiago Forte&lt;/a&gt;? He&amp;rsquo;s like a bargain bin Elon Musk who just appeared out of thin air one day and no one seems to know why. Why are people paying this man &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20210101170747/https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/&#34;&gt;$5000&lt;/a&gt; to go &lt;em&gt;right click&lt;/em&gt; ➡ &amp;ldquo;New text file&amp;rdquo;? I don&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in that vein, blogging feels like a zettelkasten hidden in plain sight. It carries all of the benefits of one without having to think about the wider ecosystem and that sounds pretty comforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having convinced myself that reducing the scope of each blog post is probably a good idea while writing this post, I&amp;rsquo;ve now got an entire scrawl of at least 5 different topics on my normally empty whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t even done anything yet and so far, it seems pretty promising!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I just take a second to say that it feels massively ironic that most of the literature around zettelkasten topics are so dense to the point of giving me a brain aneurysm.
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Like, just go back and have a look at that &lt;a href=&#34;https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/&#34;&gt;earlier link for zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt;. What the hell is that?! That&amp;rsquo;s a thesis, not an introduction!
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s almost as bad as that &lt;a href=&#34;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017089-maple-shortbread-bars&#34;&gt;New York Times recipe&lt;/a&gt; that starts off by referencing 9/11.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute, the internet is basically just one big zettelkasten?!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been stuck in a dilemma with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatsbyjs.com&#34;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; between &amp;ldquo;Oooh, looks shiny&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;This is going to erode in like 2 years, isn&amp;rsquo;t it&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
It does actually have some nice functionality but whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth the risk is an important question, not to mention the insanity that is &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that might seem like an overly negative view, and congratulations to any business that survives the pitch meeting/incubator gauntlet, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but believe it never ends well as you get deeper and deeper into funding, and the later investors also want their 40,000% return.
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Slowly, the crushing expectations of higher profits cause you to reduce the feature set and raise the price or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll manage to IPO and jump ship with a nice bag of cash before the whole thing starts slowly sinking into the ocean.
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
The foundations feel unstable right from the second you sign the agreement.&amp;quot;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Is anything happening behind the curtain?</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/is-anything-happening-behind-the-curtain/</link>
      <description>The difference between nothing and something depends on whether the curtain has been raised yet</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 15:41:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/is-anything-happening-behind-the-curtain/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week has definitely been one of the more interesting ones I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze&#34;&gt;GameStop short squeeze of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. A pretty fascinating event, that seemed to highlight far more structural issues than the original squeezer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/articles/keith-gill-drove-the-gamestop-reddit-mania-he-talked-to-the-journal-11611931696&#34;&gt;/u/deepfuckingvalue&lt;/a&gt; could have ever predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues to arrive from this event, and one to keep in mind, is the belief that &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinhood.com/us/en/&#34;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; blocked users from buying stock. While I&amp;rsquo;m no day trader, it may turn out that what initially looks like a villanous attempt to screw the little guy is &lt;a href=&#34;https://pca.st/gw6fvzay&#34;&gt;actually the result&lt;/a&gt; of Robinhood being asked to put up even more money to protect against the risk involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter because they effectively look the same. Whether an attempt to screw the little guy or a genuine, albeit irresponsible situation they&amp;rsquo;ve found themselves in, because they can&amp;rsquo;t communicate via any other language than corporate press release jargon, users struggle to tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t really a post about finance though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second event that just so happened to occur this week and is not of any particular note other than I read about it on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; a little bit, is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355663753380032512&#34;&gt;suspension of Element&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store&#34;&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the unaware, Element is essentially a chat client. The servers it connects to are hosted by users rather than all living under one company such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://messenger.com&#34;&gt;Facebook Messenger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.whatsapp.com/&#34;&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;. Ah wait, those are the same company&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also an instance where, due to Google being uncommunicative, users can&amp;rsquo;t discern between malicious intent and &amp;ldquo;the algorithms&amp;rdquo; accidentally making a user report as being reason to take down a chat client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I understand corporate policy means that Google can&amp;rsquo;t openly state why or what triggered problems, it only fuels the sentiment that Google is picking winners and losers at a whim. The lack of transparency provides space to theorise that &amp;ldquo;Ah, Google has a chat client. Many in fact! They must be protecting their own and putting a dampener on competition.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That very well could be true! Personally, I subscribe to the idea that most malicious things are actually just people in close proximity either being inept or actually being malicious for their own reasons, and that proximity creates the illusion of a wide group &amp;ldquo;pulling the strings&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never really thought about why I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at that conclusion before now but I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a mix of &amp;ldquo;It sounds like a good middle of the road option&amp;rdquo; (which can be a bias in itself as well mind you) mixed with the thought of &amp;ldquo;If everything were controlled, why is there so much disorder. We should be much deeper into dystopic territory by now, none of this slow burn crap&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, with all these things stewing in my head, something clicked which is what caused me to sit down right now and churn out this post. It reminded me of one of my old work places. Some of the people leads had a program of sorts that was going to work through previous issues and err, I dunno, make it a better place to work? It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an awful place but it had some instances of &amp;ldquo;Why would anyone think this is a good idea?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure if anything came of those attempts. Maybe a lot changed? If it did, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell and that can definitely be the case when things change slowly over time. Either way, one of the things I used to say in my 1:1 review meetings is something like &amp;ldquo;The difference between a whole lot of stuff happening behind the scenes, and nothing, are pretty much the same&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is to say, imagine yourself watching a play. You&amp;rsquo;re sitting in the front row and the curtains are down. You might start daydreaming about all of the scrambling that must be going on backstage. Actors taking their ready positions. Set people hurridly putting the final touches in place. The lighting people making sure they don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally turn the lights up too slowly at the begining, as I once did back in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that very same moment, someone across the aisle from you is probably thinking &amp;ldquo;What are these people doing? Nothing is happening! What a waste of money if they can&amp;rsquo;t even start on time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this can be chalked up to not understanding, in this case, the requirements of putting on a play. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot! I don&amp;rsquo;t even particularly know myself in great depth so someone who runs those sorts of things surely appreciated the nuance needed to get such a thing running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose all this is to say, it feels like an all too common occurence where a little (or a lot) of transparency can help escape these otherwise unenviable situations. Had Robinhood simply outlined that they fucked up and that they didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough capital to allow trading, maybe we&amp;rsquo;d be in a different position. It would still suck for them but they would be branded as stupid for a little while rather than being branded as &amp;ldquo;Illuminati corporate shill who fucked the little guy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That does go against human nature though where the expectation is that it&amp;rsquo;s safer to be obtuse so that your choices (often with limited information on hand) can&amp;rsquo;t be criticised and ideally not even spotted at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned the series before, which just outlines how much I appreciate the idea, so once more I&amp;rsquo;m going to share the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4I5cq2DfrSpehLO_71NCjKSZE0nGXIvf&#34;&gt;Evernote Behind the Scenes&lt;/a&gt; series that they&amp;rsquo;ve still been going on with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a company that has been understood as having &lt;a href=&#34;https://usefyi.com/evernote-history/&#34;&gt;fallen by the wayside&lt;/a&gt;, I think this is one of the more innovative things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen which genuinely makes me want to see them succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, innovative isn&amp;rsquo;t even the right word like it&amp;rsquo;s not a new or particularly amazing idea but it takes a lot of guts to actually do so props to them and honestly I kind of aspire to do something like that one day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Latency as a forcing function</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/latency-as-a-forcing-function/</link>
      <description>Sometimes latency is good?</description>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 14:53:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/latency-as-a-forcing-function/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m probably not alone in admitting that sometimes &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; checking work apps can be pretty hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my previous job, we used Slack and partly due to the cozy nature of some threads, I&amp;rsquo;d often find myself opening it without noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed colleagues do this too, often at social events, where they suddenly snap back to reality and realise &amp;ldquo;Wait, what the hell am I doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that Slack isn&amp;rsquo;t the super snappiest application but compared to one of the current chat mediums at my workplace, it may as well be a bullet train in terms of latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a glimpse into what you could be enjoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-perils-of-javascript&#34;&gt;The perils of Javascript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Mattermost is primarily a web based chat application, I tend to use the desktop client which isn&amp;rsquo;t much more than an electron wrapper around the very same website so the experience is mostly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server is hosted on premises, for data sovereignty reasons, which means that all of the data is loaded direct from Germany with no CDNs in the middle for the very same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That in itself I don&amp;rsquo;t have any trouble with but gosh, can it be slow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I usually end up staring at a number of times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;empty-frame.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of a dead Mattermost client. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s an electron desktop app but all it is rendering is a single tab and the rest of the screen is blank. There are no loading indicators at all.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a user, I would hope for at least a loading spinner but that spinner is contained in the Javascript bundle which&amp;hellip; the server is sometimes too flaky to serve it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, when this happens, I usually reach for the View menu and click the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;clear-cache.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the View menu for Mattermost. It shows a number of options with &amp;amp;ldquo;Clear cache and Reload&amp;amp;rdquo; being highlighted. This menu also contained an item called &amp;amp;ldquo;Developer Tools for Current Server&amp;amp;rdquo; which we will be accessing later.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previously mentioned flakiness still causes troubles from time to time so it takes a couple of tries. I often click the &amp;ldquo;Developer Tools for Current Server&amp;rdquo; option seen above to see what exactly is happening under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what a dead request usually gives me, and is generally the cause of the blank frame you saw earlier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;loading-stuck.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the previously mentioned developer tools. They look identical to the usual browser developer tools. The Network tab is selected which shows a single HTTP request for a document that returned the status code 200 OK. It took 300 milliseconds but despite that, the frame is still blank. The browser tools give the impression that the application has finished loading despite that not being the case.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few retries, we&amp;rsquo;re able to fully load the application but only after an entire minute has passed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;total-load-time.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Network tab which contains 87 requests. That&amp;amp;rsquo;s a lot! The network transfer waterfall spans 65 seconds which is crazy for a website. A number of the requests span anywhere between 300ms and 5 seconds.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably, it gets even worse once we dig into some of the culprits. Here is one which is a Mattermost plugin called &lt;a href=&#34;https://integrations.mattermost.com/standup-raven/&#34;&gt;Standup Raven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;standup-raven.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Network tab that has been cropped to just a couple of network transfers. One for a plugin called Standup Raven has been selected which took a total of 19 seconds to download!&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whopping 1/3 of the download time appears to be used up for a single plugin! To make matters worse, these plugins appear to be parsed first before any of the actual chat content is fetched so the Mattermost window sits unusable until all plugins are downloaded before progressing to fetch messages and channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the network request, the bundle is &lt;em&gt;a whopping 1.8MB&lt;/em&gt; and that&amp;rsquo;s after being gzipped. That&amp;rsquo;s bigger than the actual client bundle itself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My browser reported that the plugin was 7MB uncompressed so I was concerned that I was horribly misinterpreting this information, I looked up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/standup-raven/standup-raven&#34;&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt; for Standup Raven and took a look at the latest release which is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/standup-raven/standup-raven/releases/tag/v3.2.0&#34;&gt;v3.2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the plugin on offer was distributed as part of an 11.1MB &lt;code&gt;tar.gz&lt;/code&gt; archive and the bundle itself weighs in at &lt;code&gt;7.4MB&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;plugin-installation-size.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot showing the Javascript bundle for Standup Raven open in the authors Downloads directory using macOS finder. This finder window is sitting open over the top of the latest Github release. The Github release shown distributes tar.gz bundles for Windows, macOS and Linux. Each tar.gz is 11MB with the downloaded bundle while the main.js bundle the author downloaded is 7.4MB. This lines up with the download size mentioned before.&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-the-forcing-function-here&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the forcing function here?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given how flaky the Mattermost client can often be, I actually stopped using it for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked it maybe one or twice a day but for the most part, I don&amp;rsquo;t want anything to do with it and honestly, this has been great for my work life balance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not to say that I have any work life balance but at no point do I &amp;ldquo;fear&amp;rdquo; missing out because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) The experience is unmanagable to the point where I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be involved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) My other non-European colleagues tend to have the same troubles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now these points might seem negative but funnily enough, it has actually delivered some pretty solid value as a quirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how much latency is sometimes involved, with messages taking a couple of seconds to send at times, the amount of user traffic at any given time is often quite low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a constant stream of discussions and emojis flooding into my laptop over websockets. It&amp;rsquo;s pure quiet bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of that is due to timezones mind you but that only adds to the asychronous nature of Mattermost within our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels more akin to a notice board or an old school forum where you can back and check your thread the next day, and despite what you might think, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have any effect on efficiency that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, I spend much less time checking Mattermost than I used to pouring over Slack due to FoMo or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s urgent, you can always page me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;could-you-fix-this&#34;&gt;Could you fix this?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I did contact the administrators of our Mattermost instance but I think they&amp;rsquo;re non technical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response I got was akin to &amp;ldquo;It works on my machine. Have you tried Google Chrome?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of fiddling, I realised that simply adding a &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en&#34;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; block rule for the plugin configuration API endpoint means that Mattermost never learns what plugins exist, and so just skips on to fetching actual content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this restricts you to using the browser, it shaves a decent 20 seconds off the startup time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly though, I somewhat prefer the experience as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forced to be asynchronous as most useful chat platforms should be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Managing subscriptions with an extra debit card</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/subscription-management/</link>
      <description>In which I save myself from financial hell by putting subscriptions on another card where they can&#39;t creep up on me</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2021 23:40:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/subscription-management/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The title says it all really but I&amp;rsquo;ll go into detail a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the handiest tricks I ever discovered earlier last year, was to get a second debit card issued specifically just for subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, I used to just have my primary account tied to my debit card, and a couple of others that weren&amp;rsquo;t accessible through any physical means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few times, I would get a bit too eager to try out subscription services and slowly, my primary account would get eaten. Similarly, surprise yearly renewals would suddenly eat a portion of my bank account to my horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; for this was to transfer all of my money instantly out of my primary account and across to another savings account. I&amp;rsquo;d keep a minimal amount on my card and perform transfers on the fly as I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually caused me a lot of grief once when I was trying to check into a hotel while visiting America. My bank actually had maintenance on their mobile app so I was stuck with just shy of the required bank deposit and no way to access any of my money. Thankfully, the clerk let me pay it in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got particularly bad when I joined a gym. They would do their debit charges on a Friday but I swear it never felt consistent. Sometimes it would be on a Saturday or it would be first thing Friday morning. More than a few times, I forgot or be late, causing both the charge to decline and myself to pay a dishonour fee as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, at this point, you may think that I should have been more vigilant in transfering across the required amount which brings us full circle. Sometimes I would perform a transfer for the required amount the night before&amp;hellip; only for a subscription renewal to eat into the balance, causing a decline because what the heck, suddenly I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it occured to me that when you break it down, there are two streams of charges: those that are controlled (ie I physically swipe my card) and those that I would call erratic. The latter are often a known quantity but soetimes they&amp;rsquo;re a moving target, sometimes my dumb human brain forgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the feeling is that of being inside of an interrogation room. That is to say, there&amp;rsquo;s a kind of one way mirror where I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what could jump out at any minute and eat my wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, what I did was requested a second debit card that I use entirely just for subscriptions and the like. I don&amp;rsquo;t do anything fancy, just roughly eyeball how much is expected to go out based on last month and transfer it in. Every week or so I&amp;rsquo;ll move amounts in and out based on how close to the mark I&amp;rsquo;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very handy side effect is that you&amp;rsquo;ve also got a clear view into your recurring expenses. Often times you can forget you&amp;rsquo;re subscribed to something for a long time because the transactions are buried amongst your life stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your subscription only bank account, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a continuous feed of things you&amp;rsquo;re subscribed to and hey, you didn&amp;rsquo;t even need to pay a SaaS company to figure it out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Will we ever get solid systems?</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/solid-systems/</link>
      <description>Is software reliable? Probably not</description>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/solid-systems/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I had a crystal ball in front of me, one of the things I would like to ask is &amp;ldquo;Will we, the human race, ever get solid systems?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID&#34;&gt;SOLID&lt;/a&gt;, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what that means, but you know, robust and just generally not prone to letting the user fall right through the cracks by taking an unexpected route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of a couple of examples from the past month or so but they&amp;rsquo;re purely anecdotal of course. There are plenty of great systems that work 99.99% of the time, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFTPOS&#34;&gt;EFTPOS&lt;/a&gt; or the toilet in my bathroom but I also don&amp;rsquo;t know how you would even go about using such a thing in a way that breaks it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s not really my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just recently, I bought a delivery saver coupon from my local supermarket. It means that I can get as many deliveries as I want during a 3 month period and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay a delivery fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems pretty straight forward and I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to buy one so I thought, why not. I&amp;rsquo;ll buy one and then I&amp;rsquo;ll use it on my next grocery order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It exists just like any item on the store website so I added it to my cart. I was being lazy and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to expend the mental energy on thinking what to buy so I just got that for now since I&amp;rsquo;d get to use it shortly. It&amp;rsquo;d be silly to buy it only to have to wait for my next order to get the discount anyway, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I added it to my cart and then it asked me if I wanted it delivered or if I wanted to pick it up in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a strange question. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it just a coupon code? Ah, I bet it&amp;rsquo;s just a bit of a hack and they have a service at the end which emails me the coupon code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to cause any undue trouble, and it&amp;rsquo;s more hassle for me to receive a delivery in the first place so I chose to pick it up at 8am on a Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my confirmation sure enough and&amp;hellip; no code. That&amp;rsquo;s weird and I can&amp;rsquo;t find the coupon code input either but ah, it&amp;rsquo;ll probably arrive in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday rolls around, and I had since forgotten I had bought the code (I&amp;rsquo;m really bad at procrastinating my grocery orders) and I get a text message saying my order is ready to pick up in store. Great, I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll go over there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, one staff member checked all of the customer pick up lockers and there was no dice. Next, they said they&amp;rsquo;d try and well, I think the assumption was that this was something perhaps to be printed out in the back office? I figured maybe it was something like gift card but no one really seemed to know what form this actual delivery saver took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third staff member went out back and after about 10 minutes, they returned with a copy of the receipt and no coupon code. It turns out that despite there being an item, just like any other item on the store website, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to actually retrieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s more like an account flag that signifies to the order picker to scan a barcode, from a sheet of barcodes they have at their back desk, and that applies the delivery discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would have been nice to know beforehand. The downfall here I suppose is that I had expected this item to operate just as any other item would in that it represents an asset whether it be a physical item or a digital barcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my defense however, the system in question still treated it like any other item by creating an order, forwarding that order to someone to go and &amp;ldquo;prepare&amp;rdquo; and then causing trouble for the staff members who were confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What likely happened is that whoever entered this item into the system made the assumption that it would always be bundled as part of an order. I wonder if anyone considered the possibility of just buying that item by itself. Worse yet, I bet if I had requested a delivery, a truck would still have stopped by my house with the driver unsure what was actually requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you could arguably induce confusion (and pollution) by using an ordering system incorrectly is borderline insanity but one that we live with daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, I had recently booked a doctors appointment online for a late Monday morning. Before Monday came around, I had received an SMS telling me that the doctor didn&amp;rsquo;t work Monday and that they had cancelled my appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, that seems like an odd way to treat your patients but sure, I get it. Secondly, why is scheduling so hard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dislike nothing more than invoking the current year, as if that is any sort of claim to having made progress. Having existed for X number of years doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean we&amp;rsquo;ve collectively progressed in any meaningful way. I bet you the Greeks were no better at scheduling that we were for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to book a new appointment but how am I supposed to know if that won&amp;rsquo;t get cancelled either? How can I have any faith in a system that lets me book timeslots that don&amp;rsquo;t exist? This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time it has happened before either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the time and money that employers spent on having to pay workers less and get more out of their existing cost, it baffles me to no end that they would let employees spend god only knows how many hours a year having to deal with systems that let you do things that should be invalid but still pass validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, is anything I&amp;rsquo;ve said so far actionable? No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we going to get solid, reliable systems and finally see the light as a society? Definitely not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest issue I imagine is just a general lack of feedback, in a system sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is only one cashier overseeing the self checkout area, and 4 people have been blocked by the &amp;ldquo;Nice alcohol. Are you over 18?&amp;rdquo; prompt, followed by another person who wants their package then that&amp;rsquo;s not a good system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly it&amp;rsquo;s heavily bottlenecked and there should be more staff, yes but the only inputs I get are doing nothing (still a choice) or getting shitty with the attendant hoping that it escalates my situation up to the top of their work queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of those options have any lasting effect, or even make it into a review of how the system operates, which is barely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don&amp;rsquo;t know who works on these sorts of customer facing bits of software but a little QA wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go amiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, get a bunch of kids to use your system and ask them if they can try and break it. I feel like they&amp;rsquo;d be better at imagining all of the silly permutations like &amp;ldquo;I want a cheeseburger with no cheese, no patty and no bun&amp;rdquo;, which is a very real thing you can order at a McDonalds self service. It&amp;rsquo;ll still cost you the price of a cheeseburger but it&amp;rsquo;s more than worth it watching the ordering system (ie fry cooks) be uttly baffled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it has no economic impact on anyone above the ground floor. Why can&amp;rsquo;t there be loopholes like this for hedge funds. That&amp;rsquo;d be cool to watch seize up for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a bit of irony. The store in question was testing out a new &amp;ldquo;Scan and go&amp;rdquo; system. The idea is you scan all of your items and go. The execution fell apart though because one couple needed a supervisor to sign off on their purchase. Maybe they had bought wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ended up waiting there for a good five minutes while the attendant had to balanced between some guy buying like 10 bottles of cordial, 2 people waiting for alcohol checks (one of which was me, perhaps to no ones surprise) and said couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for scan and go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tidying up towing data with Pandas</title>

      <description>A step by step walkthrough on how I cleaned up some data as part of a side project</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>

      <content type="html">&lt;div class=&#34;notice&#34;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
  I am not a lawyer! Oh, I meant to say data scientist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across this post in an archive folder, fully written out as you see below but never published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a data analyst or even really proficient in Pandas by any stretch of the imagination so don&amp;rsquo;t take any of the below as best practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can claim however is that it worked, more or less, so you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to code along.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a pretty lengthy blog post detailing how I took an XLSX spreadsheet with towing data and cleaned it up to be (mostly) machine readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ultimate goal is to transform it into a fancy data visualisation. I know roughly how to get there but getting there is tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than leave code snippets lying around my hard drive, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That and I&amp;rsquo;m going to forget how to do any of this if I don&amp;rsquo;t explain it step by step!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-the-data&#34;&gt;Getting the data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first, and sometimes hardest step. My advice is to be as explicit as is reasonable when requesting the data. It&amp;rsquo;s helpful to be particular about what metadata you&amp;rsquo;re after, and it&amp;rsquo;ll help you if you request to receive it in a machine readable format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I received an XLSX file. Not as ideal as a CSV or GeoJSON but also better than receiving a PDF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see my original request and even get a copy of the data &lt;a href=&#34;https://fyi.org.nz/request/11018-request-of-towing-data-for-three-tamaki-makaurau-police-districts#incoming-39588&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;parsing-the-data&#34;&gt;Parsing the data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to see what we&amp;rsquo;ve actually got to work with and then we can parse it into a nicer format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; ls

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s not going to work! We need to use some tools that can actually parse this data. For that, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://pandas.pydata.org/&#34;&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;, a data analysis library for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post isn&amp;rsquo;t intended to teach you how to use Pandas, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be specific enough that you should be able to follow along with the provided dataset yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandas has support for importing Excel spreadsheets by using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://xlrd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34;&gt;xlrd&lt;/a&gt; library so let&amp;rsquo;s install both. We&amp;rsquo;ll also fetch sqlite3 which we&amp;rsquo;ll use near the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; pip install pandas xlrd sqlite3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Collecting pandas
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Installing collected packages: numpy, pandas, xlrd
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Successfully installed numpy-1.18.1 pandas-0.25.3 xlrd-1.2.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to import our Excel spreadsheet into a Pandas dataframe but there&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a catch first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; python

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our workbook is not one big sheet but in fact, one sheet per month. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t use Excel (ie me), sheets are those tabs at the bottom of the application. Usually you&amp;rsquo;ll just see &amp;ldquo;Sheet 1&amp;rdquo; when viewing a blank spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still need to parse each sheet, one by one, in order to get a complete collection of data. To do so, we&amp;rsquo;ll just iterate over each sheet and append it to an initially empty data frame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; python

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the date column, there&amp;rsquo;s a pattern that sticks out. The data is actually grouped visually by day like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[empty cell]
Monday, 01 Aug 2016

[empty cell]
02:04 a.m.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no consistency from a machine readable point of view so we&amp;rsquo;ll have to clean it up into something more consistent manually. Before we do that, let&amp;rsquo;s get some column headings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; pprint &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; pprint

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Unnamed: 0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Date and Time &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Vehicle &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Towed From &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Towed Too &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Unnamed: 5&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Unnamed: 6&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Unnamed: 7&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick skim of the dataset, we can see that only &lt;code&gt;Unnamed: 5&lt;/code&gt; is used. We&amp;rsquo;ll discard the unused columns and then clean up the remaining data:&lt;/p&gt;

You can&amp;rsquo;t quite tell from the code snippets but there&amp;rsquo;s actually some rogue whitespace in the columns so I opened to rename all of them for consistency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better! We&amp;rsquo;re almost in a position to start parsing our dates into valid timestamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;performing-some-data-fixes&#34;&gt;Performing some data fixes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the part that was the most difficult, which I&amp;rsquo;ve already done for you thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I wrote some code to parse the dates into timestamps and it would keep breaking. I&amp;rsquo;d fix the offending piece of data, run it again and see where it broke next. I&amp;rsquo;d keep doing that until the script ran to completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the following data fixes, provided so you can follow along entirely with my process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;df &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; df&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;replace(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Sunda, 28 Aug 2016&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Sunday, 28 Aug 2016&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;df &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; df&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;replace(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Satruday, 06 Jan 2017&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Saturday, 06 Jan 2017&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;df &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; df&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;replace(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;14:55 pm&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;2:55pm&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;df &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; df&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;replace(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;4.37 p.m.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;4:37pm&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;df &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; df&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;replace(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;4.22 p.m.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;4:22pm&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;df &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; df&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;replace(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;4.32 p.m.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;4:32pm&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transforming-dates-into-valid-timestamps&#34;&gt;Transforming dates into valid timestamps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that our data is in much better shape, we can tackle arguably the part that really got me thinking. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t difficult in a blood, sweat and tears kind of way but was definitely a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I walk you through what I settled for, I&amp;rsquo;ll caveat that there may be more ideal ways of doing this. What I wrote got the job done and that&amp;rsquo;s all I cared about ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our date column includes pseudo-headings, I realised I can just pass over the whole column once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the word &lt;code&gt;day&lt;/code&gt; is in a column (as it would be in every heading), we can use that cell to determine the date we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten up to. Any time below that cell implicitly refers to that date so we can merge it into the following cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a visual example of what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Before&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;After&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Monday, 01 Aug 2016&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Monday, 01 Aug 2016&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8:34 a.m.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Monday, 01 Aug 2016 8:34 a.m.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tuesday, 23 Jul 2019&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tuesday, 23 Jul 2019&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4:00 a.m.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tuesday, 23 Jul 2019 4:00 a.m.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9:42 p.m.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tuesday 23 Jul 2019 9:42 p.m.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here isn&amp;rsquo;t to get super accurate timestamps just yet, but rather something good enough that is consistent and therefore parsable. The rest of the mess, such as those &lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt; are trivial to get rid of later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s the shortest possible version of the code required that I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; current_date &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; idx, entry &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;enumerate&lt;/span&gt;(df[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Date&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;]):
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;     item &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;(entry)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;day&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; item:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;             current_date &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; item
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;day&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;nan&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;             df&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;iloc[idx][&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Date&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; pd&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;to_datetime(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;current_date&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;ll take a little bit to run, as it has to iterate over every row but it leaves us with something pretty promising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; df
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                      Date          Vehicle  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;      Destination Suburb
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;                      NaN              NaN  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;              NaN    NaN
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;      Monday, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;01&lt;/span&gt; Aug &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;              NaN  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;              NaN     &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;01&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;  TOYOTA FUNCARGO  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; PUKEHANA AVE     &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;01&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;06&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;          AUDI A3  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;A CROMWELL ST     &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, I lied earlier. We use the &lt;code&gt;pd.to_datetime&lt;/code&gt; function earlier to generate entirely valid timestamps.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;rsquo;re nowhere near done just yet, I think this is a good place to cap off this post as moving forward, the dataset will shift out of Pandas as we start to translate towing addresses into tangible GPS coordinates. Once we&amp;rsquo;ve got coordinates, we can begin plotting this data on a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I learnt a lot about Pandas by going through this whole ordeal. At first, I thought no way could this data set possibly be cleaned up but with enough head banging, anything is possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;exporting-the-data&#34;&gt;Exporting the data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than just leave this data sitting in memory, let&amp;rsquo;s export it into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/index.html&#34;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; database so we can play around with it a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need the &lt;code&gt;sqlite3&lt;/code&gt; python package installed which I recommended installing near the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to set an index or trying to export the dataset will fail. Not quite sure why but presumably it doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with the default index. I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked into it but we&amp;rsquo;ll just set our timestamps as the new index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that a human is entering this data, I highly doubt any of our timestamps clash. That said, it&amp;rsquo;s always a good idea to choose something truly guaranteed to be unique so consider yourself warned :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;re ready to export it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; sqlite3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; sqlite3&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;connect(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;towing.db&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; conn:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;     df&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;to_sql(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;towing&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, conn)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should now have a file called &lt;code&gt;towing.db&lt;/code&gt; sitting in the same directory that you opened your Python REPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to use a GUI tool like &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlitebrowser.org/&#34;&gt;DB Browser for SQLite&lt;/a&gt; to play around with it. You might notice that we&amp;rsquo;ve still got some data that isn&amp;rsquo;t quite right and such is the life of data analysis I suppose. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know since I&amp;rsquo;m just a hobbyist, hahaha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s run a sample query to see the top 5 cars just to cap this post off once and for all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; vehicle, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;COUNT&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; towing
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;GROUP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; vehicle
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;ORDER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; DEST
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;LIMIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get the following table back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Vehicle&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Count&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TOYOTA COROLLA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SUZUKI SWIFT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1602&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NISSAN TILDA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1251&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;VOLKSWAGEN GOLF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1146&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HONDA FIT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1089&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cool. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m rubbish at SQL so this should be a fun dataset to experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Configuration is great! Magic... not so much!</description>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/configuration-magic/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself qualified enough to write much on the art of programming but I think this is probably the closest I&amp;rsquo;ve ever found myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-situation&#34;&gt;The situation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently looking at a repo for controlling infrastructure which is comprised of a lot of &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; files, and the documentation was a bit sparse, at least as far as I can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the specifics of the domain don&amp;rsquo;t really matter too much, the repository mainly defines a lot of compute resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make it easier to visualise, here&amp;rsquo;s an example that roughly shows how it&amp;rsquo;s laid out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; tree Resources
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Resources
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;├── &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;│   ├── teamA.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;│   ├── teamB.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;├── staging
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;│   └── teamB.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;├── production
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;│   ├── teamA.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;│   ├── teamB.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;│   └── teamC.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each team has a &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; file per environment and each file defines a variety of resources such as databases, caches and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look inside a file to see an example. Once again, I&amp;rsquo;m using entirely made up values but the idea is roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; less Resources/test/teamA.yaml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;MySQL&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	- &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;: my-sturdy-database
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;Group&lt;/span&gt;: TestResources
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;Resource&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	  	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;Size&lt;/span&gt;: PrettyBig
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;Purpose&lt;/span&gt;: EatingMemory
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;Replicas&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;Varnish&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	- &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;: cache-me-up-scotty
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;Group&lt;/span&gt;: TestResources
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;Resource&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	  	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;Size&lt;/span&gt;: ModeratelyBeefy
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should note that we use neither &lt;code&gt;MySQL&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Varnish&lt;/code&gt; (to my knowledge) as they&amp;rsquo;re just made up examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst that lot were also cloud resources and other things defined but the point is that there seemed to some sort of structure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as how I actually define anything, I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, I can&amp;rsquo;t just arbitrarily define a &amp;ldquo;Hadoop&amp;rdquo; block and get a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html&#34;&gt;Hadoop cluster&lt;/a&gt; out of thin air, that would be ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it? With no information to prove (or disprove) the idea that maybe it just magically works, I was reminded of an aspect of storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fictional-worldbuilding&#34;&gt;Fictional worldbuilding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a writer by any stretch of the imagination but quite some time ago, I must&amp;rsquo;ve have been binging some videos on storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I vaguely remember this idea that when creating a fiction world, you should &lt;a href=&#34;https://kidlit.com/breaking-the-rules-in-world-building/&#34;&gt;introduce the rules of the world&lt;/a&gt; as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe it&amp;rsquo;s best done within the first 15 minutes for a film but I had a hard time finding anything to back up that claim, although it seems sensible enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that without rules to define your fictional world, anything and everything is possible. How can you have any sense of dramatic tension when your character could just arbitrarily become a superhuman when the story requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, seeing that infrastructure repo reminded me of that, as the &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo; of what is possible aren&amp;rsquo;t clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear as well, I&amp;rsquo;d say this is only really a side effect of when someone creates their own language of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-text-a-good-interface&#34;&gt;Is text a good interface?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To a developer or maintainer who is familiar with the repo in question, the idea that none of the above is completely obvious would probably make them laugh quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as magic when it comes to writing code, in so much as there are only more layers of code below the iceberg tip you&amp;rsquo;re currently staring at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only makes sense that there is machinery tucked away somewhere, likely a handful of scripts, which are parsing these files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of poking around, and some question asking, it turns out each of the keys defined are matched against a supplied template, and those parameters are baked into the template. The resulting output is then submitted to our cloud provider and creates/updates the defined resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, one could argue that the entire idea of creating an abstraction through yaml files has mostly broken down the second a user needs to poke behind the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cruel twist of irony, some of those templates were actually deleted and so the keys supplied such as &lt;code&gt;MySQL&lt;/code&gt; in our mock example, were doing nothing at all. You&amp;rsquo;d have no idea however because text can&amp;rsquo;t really provide you feedback as a user like, say, a language with a linter might tell you about an unused variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be entirely clear, I have these same issues with most any &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; based format such as a Helm but I guess Helm has the begrudgingly awarded +1 of IDE support. Without it, I&amp;rsquo;d be tearing my hair out just as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-the-lesson-here&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the lesson here&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t really have the vocabulary to do any meaningful criticisms or suggestions here. Once I get used to the repo in question, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll never think about it again and the cycle will repeat once more for whoever comes along next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I must have missed something because there is a bit of documentation but still, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly on explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the setup follows convention over configuration but it sort of assumes you just know the convention too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose to an extent, it&amp;rsquo;s just to do with my lack of familiarity with our provider having only been a few months in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mainly wanted to capture was the feeling that arose from a lack of seeing a clear rule set. Not unlike a fictional rule set, without one, you&amp;rsquo;re sort of left to infer the boundaries of the situation you&amp;rsquo;re currently in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think at its core though, I don&amp;rsquo;t like using text or configuration files for programmatic things, as there isn&amp;rsquo;t a whole heap of feedback until you apply said file?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick something that seems like a nice alternative, perhaps &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com/product/#sdk&#34;&gt;Pulumi&lt;/a&gt;? I can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;ve really used it but on paper, it sounds kind of appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in so much as infrastructure is appealing which some days I&amp;rsquo;d rather just have a nap to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A minor tangent about... I don&#39;t remember, GTD and fruit?</description>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I ordered a fruit plate about 15 minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$20 for a fruit plate and a chai latte is pretty egregious but I think I got a blog post out of it so perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, plate is a misnomer because it came in a box but that&amp;rsquo;s besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had purchased an Apple Watch not so long ago based on the promise that &amp;ldquo;Hey, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll leave my phone at home and be less logged on&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until just the other day, Spotify streaming via cellular wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible but it seems they expanded the reach of the Beta group and so now it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that was the last, and arguably most important feature I would want to truly ditch my phone, the &amp;ldquo;dream&amp;rdquo; is now a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, whether the dream has been realised is a different story, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go so far as it call it a &amp;ldquo;false&amp;rdquo; promise because it&amp;rsquo;s really up to the user to follow through on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, none of that is neither here nor there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting on what is effectively a picnic table, in so much as it was on concrete and I have no friends, and I got thinking about the promise of Getting Things Done™&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I generally feel like shit, I got to diagnosing it a bit more given I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a phone out to distract me. The link here is that I now just walk to the gym in the morning without it since I can stream Spotify. Thanks Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I realised I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a weekly review in about 2 weeks. I took a break&amp;hellip; and then I guess a second break. I&amp;rsquo;ve done plenty of weekly reviews so it&amp;rsquo;s not like they&amp;rsquo;re hard and often can be pretty handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater problem is that I seem to think I should be doing GTD. Well, actually the problem is really just one of productivity in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m often always productive at work, as is most everyone of course. Productive outside of work? Hmm, maybe not so much. Should I be? Well, no. It&amp;rsquo;s a cliche at this point to bring up the whole &amp;ldquo;Person thinks they have to be productive because hustle culture is a thing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually read a Gary Vaynerchuk book once when I was a teenager. I think he said caring about your customer is good or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that relaxing is something I know how to do. I&amp;rsquo;ve often joked about it but it&amp;rsquo;s kind of true. If I&amp;rsquo;m reading a book, it&amp;rsquo;s usually for the naive hope that I&amp;rsquo;ll take a bunch of notes and recycle it into something for my website. I&amp;rsquo;ll often watch movies and tv shows, sure. I can&amp;rsquo;t claim that going through a backlog is an extension of relaxing so much as it is completing a checklist though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps to some extent, it&amp;rsquo;s just learning how to drop things. Not doing something I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about, and then remembering I didn&amp;rsquo;t do that thing, is still another block in the pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is part of where GTD or any other &amp;ldquo;productivity&amp;rdquo; system falls down is that perhaps it assumes you&amp;rsquo;re a reasonable person who gets up at a reasonable time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think such a thing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist if David Allen used Twitter or got distracted 9 times a day by an ocean of Slack notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I should eat my fruit box so I can have energy to go and contribute to the economy or whatever&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital Spring Cleaning</title>

      <description>As I work through deleting a bunch of accounts, I note down the various issues that make it harder than it should be</description>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s spring here in New Zealand, and unfortunately I think I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time decluttering digital items instead of physical, but I&amp;rsquo;ve still had an interesting time as a result&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-are-people-so-protective-of-my-data&#34;&gt;Why are people so protective of my data?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of my clean involved tidying up my password manager, since it tends to accumulate a lot of accounts that I don&amp;rsquo;t need anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally I err more on the side of a digital hoarder but I decided to go &lt;a href=&#34;https://genius.com/Jay-z-and-kanye-west-ham-lyrics&#34;&gt;ham&lt;/a&gt; on all the &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; I have, and so that included digital &amp;ldquo;assets&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cleaning-up-my-own-mess&#34;&gt;Cleaning up my own mess&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, deleting accounts was pretty straight forward. Somewhere under Settings would be a big red delete button, easy enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;contacting-customer-support&#34;&gt;Contacting customer support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little notch higher were those sites that I had to contact support. Some of that is understandable, for those who have data in disparate systems and/or just haven&amp;rsquo;t implemented the functionality to trigger a cascading delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most sites were fine about it. Some would offer a discount or free credit for… an account I&amp;rsquo;m not using and clearly stated as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple that asked me to provide the email for my account or username which was fine but it&amp;rsquo;s the email address I&amp;rsquo;m emailing you from…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the customer support request batch, &lt;a href=&#34;https://downloadtile.com/&#34;&gt;Tile&lt;/a&gt; was perhaps the most confusing. They asked me what year I registered my account (uhh, this year? maybe last), how many tiles I had associated (1) and the names + activation dates of tiles associated with my account. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you but I don&amp;rsquo;t keep track of these things so I just had to make a rough guess. That was yesterday so I&amp;rsquo;ll see if they accept that before escalating things. This is only made weirder by the fact that before asking those questions, they linked me a reset page for the product I have that has a tile built into it. If the questions are meant to be a security measure, giving me the answer in the same breath is kind of missing the point but oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;having-to-search-for-a-human&#34;&gt;Having to search for a human&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This category was thankfully quite small and perhaps the most fun to problem solve. Personally, I consider these to be one-off issues rather than being intentionally troubled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://darklang.com/&#34;&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; was the first contender&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the site, there&amp;rsquo;s no mention of who is behind the language. Inside the application(?), there&amp;rsquo;s no profile page or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I discovered the Slack community where one of the co-founders informed me that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a user-facing way to delete an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up having a conversation about Dark in general and I actually forgot what I was even there for. I was highly skeptical as to whether something like Dark would take off, and I still am, but I enjoyed chatting with &amp;rsquo;em so I thought I might as well try it out again. Ironically, the only product/services I was convinced (or perhaps convinced myself) to retry was one of the few that made no attempt to retain users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second contender, &lt;a href=&#34;https://autocode.com/&#34;&gt;Autocode&lt;/a&gt; (previously &lt;a href=&#34;https://stdlib.com/&#34;&gt;stdlib&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://polybit.com/&#34;&gt;Polybit&lt;/a&gt;) overlooked some email addresses that no longer existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty easy to infer the new support email by tacking support onto the end of their current domain, and they were super quick to fix it (and delete my account) so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t much trouble at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s easy to have happen as a startup changing things rapidly, including your name, combined with the number of people who go out of their way to &amp;ldquo;delete&amp;rdquo; an account probably being pretty low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, ironically I probably spent the least amount of time on this section compared to sites that had gone out of their way to try and design an offboarding process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;having-to-sign-up-for-another-thing-in-order-to-leave&#34;&gt;Having to sign up for another thing, in order to leave&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the former meets this but I consider that a lack of a process rather than a poorly designed process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the service escapes me (unfortunately) but there was one site where I had to make an account for their Zendesk-reskinned support system that was entirely different from the account I was trying to delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I had to make an account to delete an account. How stupid is that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I wrote in the ticket to &amp;ldquo;Please also delete this support account as well&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s all digital but I still can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel like I&amp;rsquo;m generating digital garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;handing-my-data-back&#34;&gt;Handing my data back&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of sites where I simply felt I had no choice but to exercise the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_option&#34;&gt;nuclear option&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I couldn&amp;rsquo;t request my data to be deleted, or even contact anyone, I suppose the account isn&amp;rsquo;t mine in any meaningful sense and I&amp;rsquo;m just leasing it so I gave the lease back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, I would generate an absurdly long password (ie 40+ characters), remove any PII and then change the email address to &lt;code&gt;postmaster@&amp;lt;domain&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, all of these services happened to have nothing in the way of invoices or anything of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not really ideal but I feel a little lighter having returned property which wasn&amp;rsquo;t really mind in the first place. It&amp;rsquo;s one more entry I can remove from my password manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-hope-is-lost&#34;&gt;All hope is lost&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were thankfully only about two sites where there was just no course of action I could find, such as no ability to change email address or seemingly contact support to get any sort of response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those sites, I just changed the password once again and logged out for the final time. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using them anyway so they&amp;rsquo;ll just join the rest of the digital waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still would have liked to have tidied up my own mess though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remaining-thoughts&#34;&gt;Remaining thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I noticed a tendency of a few of the smaller services to apologise that the application/tool didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really view it as a failing? Often times, I viewed it more that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good fit for the tool. Sometimes I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even figure out how the tool &amp;ldquo;viewed the world&amp;rdquo; so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I was going against the grain of how it was intended to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it made me appreciate even more, the hard part of product management in that I could easily provide some feedback like &amp;ldquo;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do Y thing with this tool&amp;rdquo; but I should hope that some founders know when to just discard feedback and chalk it up to a user mismatch over arbitrarily forcing concepts into their tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some tools where I didn&amp;rsquo;t use them, but I knew exactly why I didn&amp;rsquo;t use them. There were others I rarely used and one of those asked if I&amp;rsquo;d like to join an interview session in exchange for X months of their subscription tier. It got me thinking that if there were more tools, especially the ones I did have specific criticisms of, that asked for user interviews, I&amp;rsquo;d probably do some of them. Arguably, I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to do them more if there was no incentive, rather than an incentive I don&amp;rsquo;t have any use for. Personally, I just find those sorts of user interviews fun, both participating and having run a handful myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could mention how some sort of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity&#34;&gt;digital identity&lt;/a&gt; would make any of the above redundant and so on but personally, I think it&amp;rsquo;s wishful thinking, in my lifetime anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many business and individuals like to unneccessarily complicate things in a variety of ways: using email addresses as later-unchangable IDs, abstracting themselves away from users so much that you can&amp;rsquo;t find a real person or simply just viewing data as an asset to be kept, rather than a liability to be managed like any other risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that much like smoking, the best way to quit is to never start, but even that doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold true with email addresses ending up in all sorts of third party systems you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above exercise is kind of pointless in that light but I&amp;rsquo;m not really interested in entirely erasing my footprint so much as I&amp;rsquo;d just like my password manager to reflect the services that I&amp;rsquo;m actively using. I&amp;rsquo;m sure some services just have a deleted: true flag but that&amp;rsquo;s still deactivated as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll move to Europe and then I can rub my hands in glee as I fire out hundreds of pissy GDPR emails threatening vague legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, there&amp;rsquo;s an idea. I still have a few customer support requests I&amp;rsquo;m waiting on for accounts to be deactivated. If I don&amp;rsquo;t hear from them, I wonder if CCing Investor Relations would get me any sort of response?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a try later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Relying on the internet as a business</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/internet-reliance/</link>
      <description>It&#39;s wild that you can couple a physical business to digital technology to the extent that one can&#39;t operate without the other</description>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/internet-reliance/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went to get a haircut about 45 minutes before writing this post, and the internet went out briefly. I overheard one of the hair stylists say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s weird to think how much we rely on the internet, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a new thought, and this post is being made up as I write it but it&amp;rsquo;s always an interesting thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the first thing I heard when I walked in the door was &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be with you in 2 seconds, the internet has just gone out&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be quite clear, I like the hair stylist I go to. I hate haircuts so any observations are just that but naturally, I thought&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that have to do with haircuts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about it a bit while I was there and realised it must be quite hard to be a non-technical business owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, when the internet &amp;ldquo;goes out&amp;rdquo;, all sorts of things start breaking of course. You can&amp;rsquo;t reach your booking system. Perhaps people are booking still, and some managed service is confirming them automatically, but you have no visibility into your expected workflow for later that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re also not really giving proper attention to the people presently there either, since it&amp;rsquo;s in the back of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re non-technical after all, you don&amp;rsquo;t really have a mental model of all of the devices in your building and how many of them depend on ethernet or a wireless access point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, maybe you know roughly what does of course but there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of things that are easy to get about since they… always just work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually any music, or rather it stopped playing at one point. Personally, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have noticed but lo and behold, Spotify does indeed require the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have mobile EFTPOS terminals that have no cables too so I wonder if they&amp;rsquo;re running off of WiFi too. That makes them about as useful as a brick without those juicy packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this post is partly me trying to sort through my spaghetti thoughts and I think there were two main things that popped into my head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a business owner, just how many dependencies do you end up with that you don&amp;rsquo;t properly understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder to what extent, slowly over time, you get introduced to the cooler, mobile EFTPOS terminal. Don&amp;rsquo;t be tied down with all those cables, you could be trendy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, ok, I&amp;rsquo;m being heavily sarcastic, no one actually drops however much on a whim for non-essentials but with the rise in internet-connected &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo;, perhaps there ends up being an unavoidable Ship of Theseus type effect where one day, your entire business can be closed for the day if the internet goes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for business that seemingly have no real essential need for the internet, but get convinced about some cool new online booking system or whatever. I can imagine as &amp;ldquo;internet&amp;rdquo; niches dry up over time, ever more businesses will be convinced to dive into technology in order to create new niches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The booking system that the hair stylist I used is some basic bootstrap thing with some dropdowns yet there&amp;rsquo;s an entire business that makes &amp;ldquo;premium hair salon booking systems&amp;rdquo;. Perhaps the wildest part is that time is the bottleneck here, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely booking can&amp;rsquo;t physically be any more complex than it was as a kid, when staff had paper-based agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I&amp;rsquo;m just talking about places with a comparable number of staff of course. You&amp;rsquo;d want something a bit more scalable with tens or hundreds of staff but until we get hair stylists that rent out a warehouse for some sort of olympic hairdressing event, the problem space seems about the same to me as it ever did. What&amp;rsquo;s the problem we solved here exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;rsquo;m just ranting about technology but this does bring me around to my second question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there, or should there be, such a thing as technology risk assessment/dependency modelling for businesses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes back to the mention of mental models but for your average business owner, I imagine you might not really understand that technology isn&amp;rsquo;t a monolith? You&amp;rsquo;ve got disciplines ranging from wild west code slinging to &amp;ldquo;Just wrapped up a 7 month design trip visiting the wetlands of Croatia&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap is fine, I don&amp;rsquo;t hate Javascript for keeping me hostage and Zuck can grill meats all he wants but I know for sure when I look at a barebones booking system and wonder &amp;ldquo;So what do they do all day? This seems like a grad project&amp;rdquo;, their customers most likely don&amp;rsquo;t have the same point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taste in design isn&amp;rsquo;t really a concern here but I can&amp;rsquo;t help but wish there was some sort of crash course where people could work through hypotheticals like the above situation I described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what to say here other than you can&amp;rsquo;t really avoid engineering a single point of failure if you don&amp;rsquo;t even know what that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if I was trying to run a business and focus on &amp;ldquo;what actually matters&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;d probably just think &amp;ldquo;Sounds boring/complicated/nerd crap&amp;rdquo; which is ironic given, you know, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically, none of this matters. No one else noticed, or even cared, especially not enough to spend their entire lunch break writing over 70 something lines on hair styling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s perhaps something more to think about and I probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t publish this given how it&amp;rsquo;s kind of half baked but maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll inspire you to write something actionable and coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think if we still had 3.5mm jacks, I could have just streamed Spotify via mobile for them until the internet came back on. How&amp;rsquo;s that for collective action?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Thoughts upon entering my second job in the industry</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/day-one/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the night before my first day with Mercedes-Benz as a Site Reliability Engineer. This post is a sequel to &lt;a href=&#34;https://utf9k.net/blog/day-xero&#34;&gt;Day Xero&lt;/a&gt;, written a few years back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was never intended to have a follow-up, but it might be a nice reference point to capture how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling each time I&amp;rsquo;m about to enter an entirely foreign environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, that&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;entering-a-new-environment&#34;&gt;Entering a new environment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having spent so long in one place, it&amp;rsquo;s always a strange feeling having to start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good mental model of how this new office looks, or even how big it is. I mean, it seemed sizable from the outside? I suppose as long as I can find the bathroom, the rest doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m not actually concerned about the building, or being lost. If anything, it&amp;rsquo;s quite exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, human nature means you start thinking about all of the unknowns no matter what. How does everyone dress? Am I going to be underdressed? I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be overdressed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically, the bounds of what is acceptable dress code is pretty wide so it&amp;rsquo;s not difficult to find something that&amp;rsquo;ll fit any situation. All you want to do is find something that&amp;rsquo;ll do and then you can scope out the situation from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I expect people to just be specifically wearing business casual, or expect me to be. No one hired me for what I wear. It&amp;rsquo;s also just another office like any other. I think having worked in the same one for ages, I stop thinking of it as an &amp;ldquo;office&amp;rdquo;, or even a &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this whole aspect is stupid. At no point has dress code or anything of the sort come up. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it more than I probably should have which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve left it in and I think a later point might give some insight as to why it even came up in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;imposter-syndrome&#34;&gt;Imposter Syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is a classic and so there&amp;rsquo;s no point hiding it under a wishy-washy title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;m actually feeling pretty good about a fresh start so I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling this very much, but it has popped up here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t even properly met anyone yet but the general communication style has been pretty straight to the point and honest. Even if that didn&amp;rsquo;t turn out to be accurate going forward, I&amp;rsquo;m not really in the business of pretending (much) myself. If I was, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be publishing such a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to think about why I&amp;rsquo;m not too badly affected by imposter syndrome this time out, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s partly due to my general viewpoint on job interviews nowadays. That is, I believe it is job of the interviewer to determine if you&amp;rsquo;re a decent fit for a position or not. The same mentality applies for say; submitting a talk to a conference or entering anything competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, let&amp;rsquo;s say I&amp;rsquo;m not the right person for the job. Just to be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean in a meritocracy sense, because it&amp;rsquo;s questionable whether such a thing exists. In this scenario, imagine I&amp;rsquo;m just not equipped to actually do well and I&amp;rsquo;m still completely lost, even after a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only fair to say that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a failing on my part. As far as a system concerned with hiring someone goes, the fault would lie in the hiring process itself not being rigorous enough. Not only is it not something worth concerning myself with, but it&amp;rsquo;s also something I quite literally have no control or involvement in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;systems&#34;&gt;Systems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a fair bit about my job and what aspects of it I like and don&amp;rsquo;t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming, I think, is pretty cool. The idea of it being a job is something I like and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in getting better as a developer. That said, only to a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to being the best at a particular language, or keeping up with the latest fancy tools, I really don&amp;rsquo;t care to a certain extent. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ll check &amp;rsquo;em out and get somewhat decent but also I don&amp;rsquo;t for a minute think any of this stuff translates directly into a good product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it contribute? Yeah, it can but it&amp;rsquo;s just one small piece of a much larger effort that encompasses relationship building, marketing, support systems and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, all this is to say, I think I find systems in general more interesting than any specifically &amp;ldquo;tech&amp;rdquo;. Systems exist in any discipline and can be anything from a codebase to simply what inputs from eg; a Product Manager result in what outcomes from developers? Why do those inputs come about? Perhaps they&amp;rsquo;re overridden by external parties who wield a bigger stick? Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just bad communication? It&amp;rsquo;s not always clear just by taking a system at face value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all this, I&amp;rsquo;ll be going from one set of systems that I like to think I&amp;rsquo;m at least a little familiar with, to an entirely new environment where I have no idea how or why anything is done the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;ll be fun to poke things and see what outcomes you get as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;brain-dumping&#34;&gt;Brain dumping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought about it quite a bit, which is that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent about 2 1/2 years learning a bunch of things that are highly transferrable but also a whole bunch that definitely aren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every business has their own wacky way of doing things and I don&amp;rsquo;t expect for a minute that a decent amount of information I&amp;rsquo;ve come to think about day to day, will be transferrable or even useful going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t really just think my way into forgetting and I know it&amp;rsquo;ll naturally just fade over time but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to have a big wad of information floating around my head that is suddenly rendered useless almost overnight. At least, it&amp;rsquo;s useless to me anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;backdrop&#34;&gt;Backdrop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing worth mentioning, that I somehow almost forgot, is that Auckland, New Zealand is currently in lockdown which expires at midnight tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I even get inducted into my new job, there&amp;rsquo;ll be a mini-induction to cover how this business specifically deals with COVID-19 issues such as how many people can be in the office and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I was partly responsible for onboarding a few people during our first lockdown with my previous employer and now I&amp;rsquo;ll be on the other side of the fence, being onboarded myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-does-it-feel-uncomfortable-starting-from-scratch&#34;&gt;Why does it feel uncomfortable starting from scratch?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After writing all of the above, I mulled over it a bit and realised something. It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to forget that people come and go all the time when it comes to businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to think there&amp;rsquo;s some sort of spotlight on you when first starting out. You sort of imagine that everyone has been in their roles for hundreds of years and you&amp;rsquo;re joining something that has been humming along just fine without you. Time to prove yourself, recruit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not accurate at all of course. People are poached, hired, fired, resign, change roles and go on extended leave all the time. So common in fact, no one really cares beyond a certain point how a new starter is performing. They&amp;rsquo;ve got their own stuff to deal with, day to day. I know I certainly never paid attention to new people starting in other teams. I forgot some of our new starters in my previous team were just that pretty quickly. There&amp;rsquo;s no reason to think this will be any different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s literally someone&amp;rsquo;s job to handle the setup for new people starting and making sure they can start off being relatively productive. If it was rare, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be someone&amp;rsquo;s job, it&amp;rsquo;d just be an ad hoc process picked up by a group probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s about all I had off the top of my head anyway. None of the above is really useful for me to note down but I figure it might be an interesting series of posts to share with someone just starting out down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like &amp;ldquo;Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty scary starting out but here&amp;rsquo;s a look at how you progress as the years go on. You just naturally sort of figure stuff out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems to happen like that anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just sitting in my head with some popcorn and getting ready to enjoy the show. At some point, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably remember that I&amp;rsquo;m starting from scratch. &amp;ldquo;Oh no&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;ll think, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a week and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t submitted any code&amp;rdquo;, as if code submission somehow proves &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve made it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans in charge of being rational I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quicksand</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/quicksand/</link>
      <description>Being stuck in place, or believing that you are at least, is not fun</description>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/quicksand/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think one of the worst feelings is that of being stuck in quicksand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not literally but in the sense that you&amp;rsquo;re just reacting to things. It gets exhausting and then you&amp;rsquo;re suddenly lagging behind a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given you&amp;rsquo;re already starting each day at a deficit, it feels like you&amp;rsquo;re now in a race to get back to normal. That is, being on top of everything, planning ahead and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;rsquo;s just noticing the gap between where you&amp;rsquo;re at, and where you could be but that in itself can be stressful. More so than any actual task or project on your plate even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There could be a word for it but I usually just refer to it as quicksand because it feels like the more you stuggle, the more tired you get and the deeper you sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s work or side projects, it becomes tempting to spend even more of your personal time ironing those out so you can get back to square one but it never really seems to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good sign that you&amp;rsquo;re doing too much stuff that you really don&amp;rsquo;t need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of side projects, or all the things you &amp;ldquo;wish&amp;rdquo; you were doing but never seem to find the time, it might be a sign that you&amp;rsquo;ve got stuff on your backlog that you don&amp;rsquo;t really care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to look in my projects file right now, at least half of them are things that I haven&amp;rsquo;t started and looking back, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care to do them but feel like I should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of work, I think I just forget that you can say no to things that don&amp;rsquo;t have any benefit to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in a selfish sense but it can be unbalanced if you&amp;rsquo;re just saying yes to a lot of things because you can, or because you have some knowledge to share, rather than because you want to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you should go have a hard look at your projects and see which ones you don&amp;rsquo;t really want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re better off with a short list of things you actually enjoy than a long list of crap that&amp;rsquo;ll just weigh on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data hoarding seems like a large mental overhead</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/mental-overhead-of-data/</link>
      <description>Looking back on the idea of a quantified self</description>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/mental-overhead-of-data/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a post that I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined before hand, or even really considered in any particular depth. I&amp;rsquo;m just making up this post, and it&amp;rsquo;s structure as I type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few points on my whiteboard that made something click, along with some thoughts that have been frustrating me for a little bit now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://exist.io&#34;&gt;Exist&lt;/a&gt;, a service for collecting personal data. It&amp;rsquo;s run a nice Australian duo and I have no issues with the service. All of the data collection is automated, and is explicitly authorised using regular OAuth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having all of that data consolidated in one place is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still feel like I could be doing more with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could easily too, since I can export all that data at any point, and play with it or fetch certain subsets via their API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a slightly different note, it has the ability to track my day manually. I can write a short note of how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling, a rating of my mood from 1 - 5, and also I can add tags to reflect what I did during that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy enough and I can observe trends over time as more data is gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is not about data collection. Nothing here is malicious just to be clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated my mood, tags and so on for a few days now and I keep missing it. It&amp;rsquo;s an understandable side effect of being stuck inside due to a global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I really think about it, I start to realise that there is a compounding effect that&amp;rsquo;s very subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start to feel back because I&amp;rsquo;m missing out on that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel guilty because the picture I&amp;rsquo;m trying to capture is now missing some snippets of data. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer a continuous streak. I could just input from today onwards but there&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of guilt that is prompting me to backfill those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a weird self guilt that I&amp;rsquo;m not maintaining a dataset that&amp;rsquo;s as close to perfect as I can manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironic since I&amp;rsquo;m missing that data since the first 24 years of my life but this would be the same feeling if I would journalling in a notebook and missed a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there&amp;rsquo;s two things here I think I&amp;rsquo;ve identified: I have a bunch of data and I could be doing more interesting things with it, and I have another bunch of data but I&amp;rsquo;m not keeping it &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo;… even though I&amp;rsquo;m not looking back at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could though! In some hypothetical future where I stop being reactionary, actually relax and review what I&amp;rsquo;ve got collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to just throw away all that data and relieve myself of my self imposed burden to keep that dataset up to date, day after day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is becoming a massive mental overhead, and arguably an emotional liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose we expect, and hope that companies treat our data as a liability. While it&amp;rsquo;s obviously an asset to me, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason why upkeeping that data isn&amp;rsquo;t also incurring a debt of sorts. Generating data is easy but actually recording it and auditing it would of course be some sort of investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that last sentence actually reflects that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say properly but I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave this as is, given I&amp;rsquo;m writing it purely off the cuff with no edits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think all of my filesystems are mental liabilities at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s so much crap scattered across my home desktop, home laptop, work laptop, phone? Images, documents, text snippets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all crap that slowly piles up in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be cleaning it all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I should turn off my desktop icons for starters but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really address my issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to stop accumulating crap. How can I be a digital minimalist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work Google Drive is full of stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve just dumped in there and never looked at again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are shared drives I&amp;rsquo;ve been invited to, or requested access to, telling myself that I&amp;rsquo;ll make use of all of this wonderful information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s wonderful, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. It&amp;rsquo;s too much information, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m getting out of this is that if I haven&amp;rsquo;t used something, or can&amp;rsquo;t justify keeping it, I need to just delete it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of data sets I&amp;rsquo;ve requested thinking I&amp;rsquo;ll use them for cool projects but I never get around to it. Traffic data, parking data, data for this, data for that. It all becomes more and more of a liability in the back of your mind because of all of the things you &amp;ldquo;could&amp;rdquo; have done or are sitting unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bookmarks are just the same. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a stockpile of articles which might be amazing or they might be a waste of time. The more that piles up too, geez, when I actually create stuff instead of consuming content, hahaha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking and choosing is very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping books is another thing I really need to learn how to do. I&amp;rsquo;ll start one, get partway in, get bored but still slog through it. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised but the idea of having it marked as &amp;ldquo;stalled&amp;rdquo; in my mind is almost a worse fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open loops is probably the keyword here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you close them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is just removing something off a list satisfactory? Tell yourself &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m done with that book/show/codebase/movie/manga/article/course&amp;rdquo; and then move on? Seems easier said than done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps another contributor to all of this is generally using internet tools to track backlogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://trakt.tv&#34;&gt;Trakt&lt;/a&gt; for example. No authority says &amp;ldquo;Thou must finish all movies or shows they intend to watch&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to not look at a list and wish to complete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finishing one list, in one medium alone is essentially impossible in a human lifetime, let alone all mediums you might appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really have any good answers but hopefully writing all of this down means I can point to some words when I want to express my frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts, if you&amp;rsquo;ve got any suggestions. You can email me at marcus (at) utf9k.net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could of course use any other content method on my &lt;a href=&#34;/about&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; but just make sure the medium is enough to express your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make a very good &amp;ldquo;tweetstorm&amp;rdquo; if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting up Emacs inside of a WSL2 distribution</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/emacs-wsl2-install/</link>
      <description>As if life wasn&#39;t already hard enough, we can add more Windows into the mix</description>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/emacs-wsl2-install/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never really dedicated myself to Emacs despite being interested in &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/&#34;&gt;org mode&lt;/a&gt; for a little while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One barrier to entry is that I had no idea how to install it on my desktop. The more places I have it installed, the quicker I can get comfortable enough to actually use it in my day to day life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m trying out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs&#34;&gt;Doom Emacs&lt;/a&gt;, a lightweight configuration that uses vim-style bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a Vimmer either for the record. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly comfortable opening it up, moving around with H-J-K-L and editing here and there but I&amp;rsquo;m not much more productive than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s a short guide on how you too can get Emacs up and running on Version 2 of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about&#34;&gt;Windows for Linux subsystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-optional-prerequisite&#34;&gt;An optional prerequisite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href=&#34;https://x410.dev/&#34;&gt;X410&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System&#34;&gt;X Window System&lt;/a&gt; for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not hugely familiar with X or Windowing systems, it&amp;rsquo;s basically just a way of displaying applications outside of a terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, while Emacs renders perfectly fine in the terminal, I like to have it render in its own window, which is what a windowing system provides more or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other X servers for Windows but I found this one to be pretty seamless. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/&#34;&gt;VcXsrv&lt;/a&gt; is another popular alternative, although I had some configuration troubles getting it working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve done some fiddling and have provided a setup guide for it as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, feel free to skip the entire window manager portion if you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with, or prefer, running Emacs in your terminal of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-paid-but-pretty-seamless-way&#34;&gt;The paid, but pretty seamless way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should stress that while I&amp;rsquo;ve opted to purchase an X server that has some extra bits and pieces, you can use an open source, unpaid alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X410 had some decent recommendations for being an easy setup, and happened to be under a very steep discount so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give it a spin. I also ran into some issues with VcXsrv originally as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find it &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NLP712ZMN9Q&#34;&gt;in the Windows Store&lt;/a&gt; , presumably for any region. It&amp;rsquo;ll require a Microsoft account to purchase which can be a little annoying if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation should be straight forward and I don&amp;rsquo;t remember any flags that require toggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve got it installed, fire it up and you should see a silver X icon in your Windows task tray, in the bottom right of your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need to click on it (left or right, it makes no difference) and select &amp;ldquo;Allow Public Access&amp;rdquo;. See the end of this section for a note on security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the original WSL1 exposes things on &lt;code&gt;http://localhost&lt;/code&gt; (from memory anyway), WSL2 is treated like a network storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that our Linux distribution is effectively its own &amp;ldquo;computer&amp;rdquo; with its own IP address, and so firewall policies come into place, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we connect to our X server, it&amp;rsquo;ll be on an internal address such as 172.x.x.x rather than 127.0.0.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, we should be good to go! You can either read the alternative setup or skip on down to configuring your &lt;code&gt;DISPLAY&lt;/code&gt; environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon closer inspection, it seems that &amp;ldquo;Allow public access&amp;rdquo; does indeed do what it says on the tin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can confirm that I was able to forward an emacs session from my work laptop to my home desktop without any prompting. The same should hold true of any other random person on your network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you trust your network, and aren&amp;rsquo;t proxying your computer to the internet or something interesting like that, you should be fine. In that case, feel free to jump down to the environment configuration section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d sleep safer at night with some tighter restrictions, feel free to follow the Windows Firewall configuration steps I&amp;rsquo;ve suggested below, under the setup for VcXsrv. They should apply exactly the same, but to the firewall rule for &lt;code&gt;x410&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-free-open-source-slightly-more-involved-way&#34;&gt;The free, open source, slightly more involved way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who prefer to be able to either not pay for your software, or audit it, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to pick up a copy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/files/vcxsrv/&#34;&gt;VcXsrv&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a little more involved but not much more. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through the gauntlet and figured out some settings that seem to work consistently while still staying relatively secure. That said, feel free to let me know since Windows Firewall isn&amp;rsquo;t an area I tend to stray into often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and install &lt;code&gt;VcXsrv&lt;/code&gt; and then once that&amp;rsquo;s done, open up your start menu and search for &lt;code&gt;XLaunch&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run it, it should prompt you for some default settings. You can leave it set to the default (Multiple windows with the display number set to -1 for auto)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra settings should stay as the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should get to a panel for extra parameters however, and when you do, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to add &lt;code&gt;-ac&lt;/code&gt; as a flag. Without it, you&amp;rsquo;ll have some trouble down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon finishing up this configuration, you should get a popup from Windows Defender Firewall. You can click Allow but we&amp;rsquo;ll also do some further configuration next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with XLaunch all wrapped up, head to your start menu once again and search for &amp;ldquo;Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open it up, click &lt;code&gt;Inbound Rules&lt;/code&gt; and then scroll down until you find &lt;code&gt;VcXsrv windows server&lt;/code&gt; . You&amp;rsquo;ll likely have about 4 entries, with two for TCP connections and another two for UDP connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve opted to delete all of them except for one since I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to keep a UDP configuration, nor do I need two types of TCP setup but you can leave them if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can either double click, or right click and hit properties, to start modifying your firewall rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, under General, change the action to &lt;code&gt;Allow the connection&lt;/code&gt; if it&amp;rsquo;s not already set as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, we&amp;rsquo;ll be scoping down the permissions quite a bit. Well, as much as I could figure out how to anyway. I already did more fiddling here, for the sake of this post, than I probably would otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t want to allow just anyone to connect to our display server so under the &lt;code&gt;Scope&lt;/code&gt; tab, I&amp;rsquo;ve added an IP address range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;code&gt;Local IP Address&lt;/code&gt; , select &lt;code&gt;These IP addresses&lt;/code&gt; , click &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;This IP address range&lt;/code&gt; and then enter the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;From: 172.16.0.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To  : 172.31.255.255
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the Windows subsystem is treated like a network device of sorts, our display server will essentially be receiving a connection from a different computer, as far as it&amp;rsquo;s concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to mitigate any actual other computers connecting, we&amp;rsquo;re narrowing down the acceptable list of IP addresses to just those that fall within the WSL range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose if you did have a big internal network, with a computer assigned an address on 172.16.x.x, then they could connect but we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing some interface restrictions just below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, repeat the same steps for &lt;code&gt;Remote IP address&lt;/code&gt; and then hit &lt;code&gt;Apply your changes&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, what I wanted to do was reduce the scope of the &lt;code&gt;Protocols&lt;/code&gt; tab to just TCP on the ports that X server uses (6000 - 6063) but I had no such luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It potentially be the case that somewhere between WSL land and your host computer, some ports are proxied to be higher or lower, but honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m purely speculating based on no actual evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the interested, the above protocol and port restriction causes the host X server to be unreachable. If you extend the range from 6000 to the highest possible port (65535), it does indeed connect which is why it seems it&amp;rsquo;s relying on a range of ports higher than those 63 to be reachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough sidetracking. There is one extra bit of restricting we can do. Under &lt;code&gt;Protocols and Ports&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Protocol type&lt;/code&gt; , change it to just allow &lt;code&gt;TCP&lt;/code&gt; . You can then navigate to &lt;code&gt;Advanced&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Interface types&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Customize&lt;/code&gt; , and you should be able to narrow down the list to just &lt;code&gt;Local area network&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably, even if anyone is on the wider network with an IP address that happens to match our WSL2 distro, they still won&amp;rsquo;t be able to connect but I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of that nonsense behind us, we can get on to actually configuring our environment and testing that our setup has worked successfully!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuring-your-environment&#34;&gt;Configuring your environment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I briefly referenced in the setup steps for X410, WSL2 is treated as a network device of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact details are besides the point here but just know that WSL2 is effectively a separate computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means, is that we can&amp;rsquo;t rely on Emacs automatically knowing where to find our X display server (if you&amp;rsquo;re opting to use one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;ll check inside of our Linux distribution, but we need to point it to our Windows host, since that&amp;rsquo;s where our X server is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing so is only one step thankfully:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;DISPLAY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{print $2; exit;}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:0.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, easy enough but what just happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, you&amp;rsquo;ll have an &lt;code&gt;/etc/resolv.conf&lt;/code&gt; generated by WSL. Here&amp;rsquo;s what mine looks like on a relatively fresh installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# [network]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# generateResolvConf = false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;nameserver 172.31.96.1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That IP address there, &lt;code&gt;172.31.96.1&lt;/code&gt; , is the IP address for our Window host machine. At least, from WSL&amp;rsquo;s point of view anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; to get the exact line we want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;marcus@corbenik:~/code/utf9k$ cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;nameserver 172.31.96.1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and then use &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; to get just the IP address by itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;marcus@corbenik:~/code/utf9k$ cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{print $2; exit;}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;172.31.96.1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voila! One IP address. What our above command ends up evaluating to, is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;DISPLAY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;172.31.96.1:0.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That IP address can change from time to time however, which is why we want to automate setting it each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;DISPLAY&lt;/code&gt; environment variable will go away with each new shell so make sure you put it in your shell startup!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that&amp;rsquo;s let is to check that we can connect as expected. Here&amp;rsquo;s a connection test against X410, using &lt;code&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt; (netcat)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;marcus@corbenik:~/code/utf9k$ nc -v 172.31.96.1 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;6000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Connection to 172.31.96.1 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;6000&lt;/span&gt; port &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;tcp/x11&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; succeeded!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we use port 6000? It&amp;rsquo;s the first in a range of ports for X window servers, which range from 6000 - 6063. If you note the &lt;code&gt;0.0&lt;/code&gt; on the end of our &lt;code&gt;DISPLAY&lt;/code&gt; variable, we&amp;rsquo;re telling it to use display 0, screen 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we wanted to use a different display, or perhaps having a second X server may qualify, we could connect to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;:1.0&lt;/code&gt; for display 1, screen 0. Under the hood, that would live on port 6001, which is the base port of 6000 added to our display number (1 in this case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know any of that until writing this so I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to do your own research if you want to know more, or double check anything I just claimed, haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-emacs&#34;&gt;Installing Emacs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now then, we need an actual Emacs distribution but don&amp;rsquo;t get too trigger happy just yet. For the most part, running &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install emacs&lt;/code&gt; will give you an outdated package. In reality, it&amp;rsquo;s probably Emacs 25 which is more than fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to run a more up to date version, you can do the following to fetch a copy of Emacs 26. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to be on the bleeding edge (and is what Doom Emacs recommends), you&amp;rsquo;ll probably need to compile Emacs 27 from source :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo apt-get update
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo apt-get install emacs26
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very nice, you should be all good to go. If you would like to use Doom Emacs as I am, you will need some extra packages which you can find more info about &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#ubuntu&#34;&gt;via the handy documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to run Emacs in your terminal, just simply fire up &lt;code&gt;emacs&lt;/code&gt; . If you wouldd like to run it on your Windows host, and have your X server running and set up, you can run &lt;code&gt;emacs &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; to spawn it, and keep it open as a background process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy text manipulation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I wrote this entire post in Doom Emacs, launched from WSL 2 on my home desktop and it works like a charm :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reducing my everyday carry during 2019</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/reducing-my-edc-2019/</link>
      <description>For no particular reason, I documented all the crap I haul around and my plan to slim it down even further</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/reducing-my-edc-2019/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the beginning of 2019, I had quite a bit of stuff I was carrying around and it bugged me quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to reduce down the complexity by quite a large amount, and it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the better investments I&amp;rsquo;ve made recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that I haven&amp;rsquo;t discarded my previous setup (just yet), I was able to recreate a bunch of before and after photos showing my progression over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not recommending you emulate my setup but it might serve as inspiration to make your own investment, into reducing or optimising your everyday carry (EDC going forward).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, I should point out that this setup has actually be retired for something even more optimal (for me) but that&amp;rsquo;s a post for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can click on each photo to view a full size version&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-original-setup&#34;&gt;The original setup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;01-original-carry.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;An aerial photo of a table containing items I carry each day, with pieces of paper beside each item describing the problems with each. The photo contains my phone, wallet, keys and wired earbuds. I didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t actually have the wired earbuds anymore so I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve just drawn a picture to represent them.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My EDC was already fairly compact and consisted of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Pixel 3a (very lightweight!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallet packed with cards (slow to sort through + a lot of unused cards)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A carabiner with a bunch of keys (which key is which?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pair of wired earbuds (represented by a placeholder + easily gets tangled)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at these individually as we break down my setup and slowly rebuild it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;assessing-my-wallet&#34;&gt;Assessing my wallet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;02-wallet-old.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A close up photo of a table with my wallet folded open on it. A piece of paper represents my transit card as I no longer had it at the time of writing this post.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot in my wallet that I don&amp;rsquo;t use, and different cards definitely get access more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start by taking a closer look at those cards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;regular-cards&#34;&gt;Regular cards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;03-cards-scattered.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;An aerial photo of a table with numerous cards scattered around. There are different types from loyalty cards to business cards, as described below.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a variety of different cards here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business cards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gift cards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loyalty cards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membership cards (plastic + NFC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank cards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;04-business-cards.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A close up photo of two business cards. One is for stripe.com and another is for readme.com.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business cards are pretty easy to get rid of as a first step. They just went straight into my contacts list. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any need to carry them and should have digitised them a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;05-loyalty-cards.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A closeup photo of my phone with the table and cards in the background, although heavily blurred. The screen of my phone is open to an application that shows digital versions of the loyalty cards. More specifically, the barcodes for each of the physical cards has been captured onto my phone.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t use loyalty cards often enough, to make the space they take up worth it. Thankfully, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to digitise them nowadays (if they have a barcode) and carry them on my phone instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;06-gpay-cards.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A closeup photo of my phone with Google Pay open to show my digital bank card. Thankfully any identifying information has been removed. For effect, behind the phone to the side is the table again with my physical bank cards sitting on it, although blurred out for effect.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I can reduce the amount of time I&amp;rsquo;m pulling bank cards out of my wallet by adding them to Google Pay. I still need them on hand for larger purchases due to paywave limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One type of card I can&amp;rsquo;t simply digitise or reduce are my arcade cards. From what I remember, the arcade balance card itself is part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mifare.net/en/products/chip-card-ics/mifare-desfire/&#34;&gt;MIFARE DESFire&lt;/a&gt; family. Android does support &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/hce&#34;&gt;Host Emulation&lt;/a&gt; but from the little I&amp;rsquo;ve read, it isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to emulate MIFARE cards nor would a software emulation necessarily be secure anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bandainamcoid.com/banapassport/en/&#34;&gt;BANA Passport&lt;/a&gt; which I use to store my save progress with &lt;a href=&#34;https://wanganmaxi-official.com/wanganmaxi6/en/special/001.php&#34;&gt;Midnight Tune 6&lt;/a&gt;, a particular arcade game I quite enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can live with carrying those two day to day, given that visiting the arcade is more of a spur of the moment thing, so it makes more sense to keep it on hand, than say an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ebgames.co.nz&#34;&gt;EB Games&lt;/a&gt; gift card&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;transit-card&#34;&gt;Transit card&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my most used card, given I use it at least once a day on weekdays and sometimes multiple times on the weekend. Having it lumped in with all of my other cards is fine but it&amp;rsquo;d be nice if it was easier to access given it&amp;rsquo;s part of the &amp;ldquo;hot path&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I ended up doing was taking it and replacing it with one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://at.govt.nz/bus-train-ferry/at-hop-card/buy-at-hop-card/buy-an-at-hop-key-tag/&#34;&gt;limited edition HOP tags&lt;/a&gt; that Auckland Transport occasionally releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;07-hop.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A close up photo of a table surface containing three items: A piece of paper representing my physical transit card, an arrow pointing to the right and a smaller, badge sized transit card designed for keychains. The arrow is supposed to symbolise that I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve gone from one transit card to another.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re designed to live with your keys, coming with a metallic keychain, but I removed that for reasons which will be a little clearer as we continue on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reviewing-our-progress-so-far&#34;&gt;Reviewing our progress so far&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all of that reduction, my wallet is slimmed down to just the following essentials&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;08-cards.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A close up photo of a table surface showing the smaller transit card to the left, a few remaining physical cards that I like to keep around and a carabiner containing various house keys.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even carry the gift card around, instead just opting to either digitise it (if possible) or remembering to bring it whenever I decide to go in store or order online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wallet has served me well for quite some time but it&amp;rsquo;s really easy for just these few cards to fall out, since it&amp;rsquo;s designed to hold a number of cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was browsing the web one day for unique takes on wallets and I came across this thing. It looks a bit confusing at first but having used it for the better part of a year, I really enjoyed it. Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like disassembled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;09-wallet-disassembled.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A close up photo of a table surface containing a metal device that has been unscrewed. The base plate is on the right with three little stands to provide room in between itself and the top plate. The idea is that the cards sit in between the gap. The top plate is red and sitting to the left of the base plate with three small screws sitting just below it.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like much at the moment so let&amp;rsquo;s add some keys and accessories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;10-wallet-setup.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A close up photo of a table surface with just the metal base plate from the previous photo. Two of the little stands appear to have two keys sitting on them, tucked nicely so they don&amp;amp;rsquo;t extend beyond the base plate itself. The third stand has a small USB drive sitting on it.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got my three house keys, a bottle opener (under the blue key) and a USB drive all sitting snuggly in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;11-wallet-underside.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A close up photo of a table surface with the assembled metal wallet sitting on it. The wallet is upside down, with the keys and USB drive extended beyond the base plate. The bottom of the base plate is visible, as the wallet is upside down, and has a large clip at the bottom for slotting cards into.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not all. We can stick those remaining cards in the bottom card holder too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;12-wallet-underside-full.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A side photo of the assembled metal wallet, sitting on a table surface. The previously mentioned clip has been filled with about 8 to 10 physical cards at a glance. They seem to be tightly secured.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, I had some spare 3M wall hanger strips floating around so I repurposed one to affix my travel tag to the top of this contraption using velcro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;13-wallet-top.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;An aerial photo of the assembled metal wallet sitting on a table surface. It is positioned right side up this time showing the red top plate. On top of the red plate is the small badge sized transit card, seemingly hovering in place. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s actually attached to a velcro strip although you can&amp;amp;rsquo;t visually tell that from the photo.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Et voila, a pretty compact setup if I say so myself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;14-wallet-side.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A side photo of the assembled metal wallet sitting on a table surface. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s positioned in the same way as the previous photo just with the angle being from the side. If the reader were to squint, they could make out the velcro strip mentioned before but no attention is drawn to it.&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;untangling-my-headphones&#34;&gt;Untangling my headphones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to have various pairs of earbuds over the years that were good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;15-wired-earbuds.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A close up photo of a table surface with two pieces of paper. One on the left says &amp;amp;ldquo;Such a mess to untangle&amp;amp;rdquo; with a sad face and an arrow pointing to the right. The piece of paper on the right is a ridiculously bad drawing of wired earbuds with text at the top that reads &amp;amp;ldquo;Wired earbuds&amp;amp;rdquo;. I no longer had the them in my position so this is supposed to be a placeholder for the real thing.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt like I must have lost multiple hours of my life just untangling them over the years so I decided I might as well invest in a decent pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they seem to be much more popular and acclaimed these days, I had taken a gamble at the time and invested in a pair of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mightyape.co.nz/product/sony-wf-1000xm3-industry-leading-noise-canceling-truly-wireless-earbuds-black/30990778&#34;&gt;Sony WF-1000XM3 Wireless Earbuds&lt;/a&gt; during a period when the Apple Airpods were basically the only thing you were supposed to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the price, I actually opted to pay them off over a period of time (might as well build my credit score after all!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, they&amp;rsquo;ve been a worthwhile investment for me. The battery life is great, considering they&amp;rsquo;re properly wireless, and I&amp;rsquo;m always surprised how many charges I can get from putting them back in the case. When using them as a daily driver, back when walking to work was a thing, I would generally only need to recharge them once a week at most? More like once every 2 weeks I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;16-wireless-earbuds.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A side view of a table with two pieces of paper and a red almost electronic pouch looking thing that has a red glowing light. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s actually a pair of Sony WF-1000XM3 Wireless Earbuds in their carry card but unfortunately, it&amp;amp;rsquo;s hard to make out in the photo. Maybe it&amp;amp;rsquo;s just hard to make out on my monitor. Anyway, the pieces of paper are the paper placeholder of my wired earbuds and an arrow pointing right to indicate they&amp;amp;rsquo;ve transformed into the new wireless earbuds.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pleasantly surprised at the software updates that still roll out. About 6 months after I bought them, they received support for Amazon Alexa, which was a nice surprise given they already support the Google Assistant. Not that I use either…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that covers everything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve reduced my wallet by probably 90%, moved my transit card to its own dedicated spot since it&amp;rsquo;s on the &amp;ldquo;hot path&amp;rdquo; and I no longer have to spend any time untangling my headphones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;17-all-three.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A close up of three items on the table surface. To the right, and closest to the camera, is my phone. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s the Google Pixel 3a and it shows a almost purely black lock screen except for the time, some Japanese song playing on Spotify and the weather which is 19 degrees celcius at the time of the photo. To the right, also close to the camera is the carry case for the Sony wireless earbuds. At the back of the photo, and quite blurred, is the metallic wallet.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I&amp;rsquo;ve made some further changes which I&amp;rsquo;ll likely cover in a 2020 edition of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;18-all-third-alt.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A mid range shot of the same three items from the previous photo on a table surface. They are just sitting in a slightly different configuration but the details are all the same.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainly, I found that while the wallet served me well, it was a bit too heavy to take when I took up running earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fix was to just unscrew it, take out my two main house keys and keep them in my pocket but reassembling my wallet got kinda tedious pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time, see what you&amp;rsquo;re able to pull off with a wallet reduction!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My bookmarking categories in March 2020</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/bookmarking-march-2020/</link>
      <description>A weird one off post where I documented the various bookmarks I had captured</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/bookmarking-march-2020/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For no particular reason, other than I figured it might help me make better sense of how I organise articles, here&amp;rsquo;s a fairly detailed breakdown of my bookmarking setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href=&#34;https://raindrop.io&#34;&gt;Raindrop.io&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;ve also used &lt;a href=&#34;https://pinboard.in&#34;&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com&#34;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://larder.io&#34;&gt;Larder&lt;/a&gt; happily in the past too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Raindrop seems like the most comprehensive of the bookmarking apps I&amp;rsquo;ve tried. It has a very nice UI, a consistent desktop/mobile experience, a (newly launched) API and supports syncing content to a storage provider (Dropbox or Google Drive) too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve linked some articles that I&amp;rsquo;ve found interesting myself within a lot of the categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them need some work, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got almost as many unsorted bookmarks as I do sorted since I write a custom title, description and apply tags for searching rather than just dumping them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of stuff from Pocket that I archived which makes up the bulk of it. Most things I had in Pinboard were tagged so they were easy to transition into Raindrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve got any feedback or want to share your own bookmarking categories, let me know! You can find my contact details on my &lt;a href=&#34;/about&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page B)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;???&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything that is generally quirky or surprising like &lt;a href=&#34;https://audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/jerry-seinfelds-speakers.48414/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/105602/steak-dropped-in-soapy-dish-water&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://oukosher.org/blog/industrial-kosher/peanut-butter-ii-standard-of-identity/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;marketing&#34;&gt;Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lessons and resources related to marketing of products, or marketing as an art&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;resources-1&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design resources such as fonts, CSS frameworks, placeholder images or guides on how best to layout a design&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ui--ux&#34;&gt;UI / UX&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tips and tricks on providing a functional, accessible design. Generally just for web design but doesn&amp;rsquo;t strictly have to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;miscellaneous&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://digitalworldproblems.tumblr.com/post/76036641581/while-im-looking-at-that-moviecode-post-he&#34;&gt;Anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an obvious category&lt;/a&gt;. If there seems to be a grouping of related articles, it&amp;rsquo;d prompt the creation of a new category but I also don&amp;rsquo;t want to generate more categories that are useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;postmortems&#34;&gt;Postmortems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews in what went wrong, whether it be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.propublica.org/article/the-red-cross-secret-disaster&#34;&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.defmacro.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html&#34;&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fudco.com/chip/lessons.html&#34;&gt;videogames&lt;/a&gt;. As this category grows, I&amp;rsquo;ll likely split them out into eg; Business/Postmortems but for now, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a big enough collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;productivity&#34;&gt;Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything related to the art of productivity. It may also just be &lt;a href=&#34;https://nesslabs.com/jomo&#34;&gt;articles reminding you that sometimes less is more!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recommendations&#34;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things that I have been recommended but haven&amp;rsquo;t looked into yet. If they are part of a medium that I track somewhere else (eg; books into Goodreads, games into How Long To Beat), then I tend to just put them there straight away. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.neogaf.com/threads/dead-franchises-almost-nobody-but-you-seems-to-want-back.1355948/&#34;&gt;There may be threads that have a wide range of recommendations&lt;/a&gt; eg; book recommendations so I generally scour them when I get time and put the interesting items into eg; Goodreads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shopping&#34;&gt;Shopping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things that look cool and I might want to buy one day. I may also just want to keep them for reference to link to people too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;society&#34;&gt;Society&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;discourse&#34;&gt;Discourse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bit of a wishy washy grouping but anything related to discussion of ideas and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton.27s_fence&#34;&gt;what can go wrong as a result&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps communication is a clearer name for this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;governments&#34;&gt;Governments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Articles related to governments, whether it be their functions, warfare (from a political point of view, not an on-the-ground point of view) or just &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20071031080918/http://www.geocities.com/capecanaveral/4411/apollo13.htm&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;government related things&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_System_No._7&#34;&gt;specific infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; or articles about infrastructure in general ie cost overruns or how a traffic light system operates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;news-media&#34;&gt;News Media&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resources provided by the news media (eg; a database containing financial entities and their appearances in the media) or articles about the media itself. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain articles FROM the news media however. It&amp;rsquo;s more of a meta category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;People&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be articles on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Parker_(wine_critic)&#34;&gt;specific people&lt;/a&gt; (biographies, news pieces) or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scottlucas/san-francisco-spent-a-decade-being-rich-important-and&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; in a broader sense&lt;/a&gt; such as a story on a town or city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;politics&#34;&gt;Politics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politics of any form, whether it be governmental (elections, &amp;ldquo;red tape&amp;rdquo;) or more local such as office or industry politics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;world-views&#34;&gt;World Views&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bit of an abstract category. This contains articles and quotes that upon reading, I thought &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14391552&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh! This gave me some insight into how certain groups or individuals come to view the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s neither a good or a bad thing, just interesting. Often it contains things that I&amp;rsquo;ve never considered before myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sports&#34;&gt;Sports&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had two links related to wrestling I put in here. I don&amp;rsquo;t follow sports much but sometimes there can be interesting crossovers between say sports and business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;technology&#34;&gt;Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;databases&#34;&gt;Databases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Articles, Stack Overflow snippets and links in general related to &amp;ldquo;databases&amp;rdquo;. For now, this has no subcategorisation between eg; MySQL v Postgres, SQL vs &amp;ldquo;NoSQL&amp;rdquo; and databases themselves vs database concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;growing-as-a-developer&#34;&gt;Growing As A Developer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recommendations from other developers (eg; keep a logbook), utilities (resume creators, competency matrixes) and other tools for improving as a developer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-events&#34;&gt;Historical Events&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links to &amp;ldquo;historical events&amp;rdquo; which can be anything from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/20791&#34;&gt;unexpected outages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191&#34;&gt;long running debates&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.doublewide.net/passport.htm&#34;&gt;fascinating snippets that somehow haven&amp;rsquo;t been lost yet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;languages&#34;&gt;Languages&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything specific to a programming language whether it be a blog post, tutorial, library or book. At the moment, I haven&amp;rsquo;t split these out into subcategories as each article is tagged with their respective langauges anyway making search easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lower-level&#34;&gt;Lower Level&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything related to &amp;ldquo;low level things&amp;rdquo;. As someone who deals primarily with higher level languages (Python, Javascript) day to day, I classify C++ and C as low level too, haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;neighbours&#34;&gt;Neighbours&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is really just blog posts with no particular category or links to entire websites or blogs. Neighbours in this term just means other developers in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;networking&#34;&gt;Networking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it suggests on the tin, any articles, posts etc related to networking in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;observability&#34;&gt;Observability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty new and empty category. I&amp;rsquo;m misusing the term on purpose as it has links to articles relating to observability as well as monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reference-materials&#34;&gt;Reference Materials&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything (lists, lists of lists, books, websites etc) that are useful to reference. There are some things in here that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be such as books on building applications in a specific language so it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of a dumping ground at the moment. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good distinction for where language-specific guides should live (languages or reference materials?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reverse-engineering&#34;&gt;Reverse Engineering&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All things related to the art of reverse engineering such as applications, blog posts and reference guides&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;security&#34;&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it says on the tin. Recommendations as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2669690/why-does-google-prepend-while1-to-their-json-responses&#34;&gt;interesting implementations&lt;/a&gt; related to security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;shared-concepts&#34;&gt;Shared Concepts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s technical / software development related but not part of any specific category (Unicode for example), I stick it in here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-art-of-development&#34;&gt;The Art of Development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another wishy-washy category since it has some things which should be &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/&#34;&gt;part of Growing As A Developer&lt;/a&gt; as well as things that are more like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devever.net/~hl/xml&#34;&gt;how you should properly structure data&lt;/a&gt; rather than the actual act of development itself. I still need to refine this more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-industry-itself&#34;&gt;The Industry Itself&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be stories about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/library/CONTROVERSY/LAWSUITS/SEA/katzbio.txt&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; (in an individual sense)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; (in the group sense)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gigaom.com/2011/02/18/war-is-hell-welcome-to-the-twitter-wars-of-2011/&#34;&gt;people opposing other people&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=&#34;https://eager.io/blog/the-languages-which-almost-were-css/&#34;&gt;choices made by people&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>You should publish your older works</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/publish-old-works/</link>
      <description>I think it&#39;s a good idea to publish your existing work, even if you don&#39;t like it. You don&#39;t like it now but others earlier in their journey may appreciate it in a way that you can&#39;t anymore.</description>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wLP0izeJE&#34;&gt;Ira Glass on Storytelling 3&lt;/a&gt; is a video worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the first few minutes is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recommended it a number of times in the last few years, and I&amp;rsquo;ll likely continue to do so for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To repeat the premise of the video, Ira describes taste as the gap between what you can accomplish right now, with your current skillset, and what you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your taste may be &amp;ldquo;killer&amp;rdquo;, as he puts it, but that gap means you recognise your work isn&amp;rsquo;t quite up to what you consider good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gap, and the craving to close it, can be motivating in the best of times, and straight up depressing in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While progression over time will close your own gap, I would also point out the taste (and gap) of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your taste will evolve over time, but others may be far ahead or behind your current progression of taste (if we pretend there is such a thing as scale of taste for a minute)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say is that, if you&amp;rsquo;re a painter for example, you might dislike your latest work. You may even think your work from 5 years ago is utter rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps but don&amp;rsquo;t mistake that for thinking no one else is or can ever appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone years from now may strumble upon your back catalogue (online or off) and find a great deal of inspiration, knowledge or appreciation that you yourself don&amp;rsquo;t hold presently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think the same applies for software and &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; source code as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets a bit asterisky with things like objectively uncompilable code, custom frameworks that have security bugs and so on but you may have source code or old projects you think are bad, that others can gain inspiration from or just generally appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably, that&amp;rsquo;s the only reason I leave anything I&amp;rsquo;ve written online is that maybe someone else might get some use out of it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, while this can somewhat apply to software, I made a note to write this post a long time ago, in response to some artist friends who wondered why they would ever upload their old work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t make or generally seek out artworks, my own taste is pretty weak so I might appreciate an entry level &amp;ldquo;low taste&amp;rdquo; piece of work more than whatever is considered to be an &amp;ldquo;acquired taste&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of low tasters out there so you should try and embrace them :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Why setting for one gitconfig when you could have two or more</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/multiple-git-hosts/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;div class=&#34;notice&#34;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
  Some things have changed since I first wrote this&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, I was using Gitlab so you&amp;rsquo;ll see references to my dotfiles living there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve now moved back to Github but kept the references to Gitlab in this post intact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using my work laptop, I like to keep a copy of my dotfiles so that my tools at work are in sync with my tools at home. They &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/dotfiles&#34;&gt;live in a Github repository&lt;/a&gt; under my personal account, and I use plain old git to sync changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to push and pull changes from Github, I use an SSH key rather than a password. It&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to generate one of course but I also have one for the internal repository at my work. Juggling the two can sometimes be annoying when setting up a fresh laptop without some proper configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually I forget what that looks like so here&amp;rsquo;s a quick walkthrough on how you too can juggle multiple git hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at a barebones ssh configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; cat ~/.ssh/config
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Host github.example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/work
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Host gitlab.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personal
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Host github.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personal
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got three different hosts and two different SSH keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you use &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;ll check to see if you have any host blocks defined. If they match the host provided, it&amp;rsquo;ll use the corresponding configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it looks in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; ssh -T git@github.example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hi marcus! You&amp;#39;ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; ssh -T git@gitlab.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Welcome to GitLab, @marcus-crane!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection to &lt;code&gt;github.example.com&lt;/code&gt; uses the key stored at &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/work&lt;/code&gt;, while the connection to &lt;code&gt;gitlab.com&lt;/code&gt; has used the key stored at &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/personal&lt;/code&gt;. Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also add additional configuration that is specific to just one host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at an example with a few more options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; cat ~/.ssh/config
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Host github.example.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/work
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Host gitlab.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personal
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  LogLevel VERBOSE
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Host github.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  HostName notarealuser
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personal
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s mostly the same with two new commands &lt;code&gt;LogLevel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;HostName&lt;/code&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s see it in action once again before we dive a bit deeper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; ssh -T git@github.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ssh: Could not resolve hostname notarealuser: Name or service not known
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; ssh -T git@gitlab.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Authenticated to gitlab.com &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;35.231.145.151&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;:22&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Welcome to GitLab, @marcus-crane!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Transferred: sent 2036, received &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;3072&lt;/span&gt; bytes, in 0.5 seconds
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bytes per second: sent 4366.6, received 6588.4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see that we sent a request to &lt;code&gt;github.com&lt;/code&gt; and it interpreted the corresponding host block, attempting to log in as someone called &lt;code&gt;notarealuser&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most git servers, the user will default to &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and is generally part of your remote anyway. You can see it whenever you run &lt;code&gt;git remote add origin git@github.com/user/blah&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;git remote -v&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be quite handy for regular servers however. Instead of connecting with &lt;code&gt;ssh user@blah.net&lt;/code&gt;, you can add the username to a host block and shorten that command down to just &lt;code&gt;ssh blah.net&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;LogLevel&lt;/code&gt; command is fairly straight forward. You can set it to a higher level of logging, and see more details about what SSH is doing under the hood, but for a specific host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re getting error messages from your internal git host, you could toggle on &lt;code&gt;LogLevel DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; and see if your requests are making their way to the host or not as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s all sorts of interesting stuff you could do but this post isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be comprehensive by any means. It&amp;rsquo;s more of a reminder to myself on how to create an ssh config file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all of the various commands offline by running &lt;code&gt;man ssh_config&lt;/code&gt;. You can also read them online via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config&#34;&gt;OpenBSD manual page server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy SSHing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Double checking if an email address exists</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/email-lookup/</link>
      <description>There are some tricks you can use to figure out if an email address is legit</description>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/email-lookup/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll want to email someone but I don&amp;rsquo;t know if their email address is valid. Likewise, they might have verbally told it to you, but you can&amp;rsquo;t remember if it has a dot or a dash! Luckily, there&amp;rsquo;s a handy way to find out using a mix of nslookup and telnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll take you through a recent example where I wanted to email Ian Small, the CEO of Evernote, to thank him and the Evernote team for their wonderful Behind the Scenes videos. You can see them &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rNUpXYCcrA&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I think they&amp;rsquo;re worth a peek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if I had to take a blind guess, ian[at]evernote.com would be a valid email. Well, it is indeed and so that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve picked it since it&amp;rsquo;s such an obvious format. For the sake of learning, let&amp;rsquo;s just pretend we&amp;rsquo;re trying to find a valid email from scratch. Naturally, if you have a particular domain you&amp;rsquo;re interested in, just swap out evernote.com for your domain of choice. Going forward however, I&amp;rsquo;ll be using evernote.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-mail-server-macos--linux&#34;&gt;Finding the mail server (macOS / Linux)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For macOS and Linux, we&amp;rsquo;ll want to use &lt;code&gt;nslookup&lt;/code&gt; which should come ready to go as part of your OS/distro of choice. Fire up a terminal and enter &lt;code&gt;nslookup -q=MX evernote.com&lt;/code&gt; and you should get a bunch of Google domains back like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; nslookup -q&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;MX evernote.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Server:         192.168.1.1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Address:        192.168.1.1#53
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Non-authoritative answer:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;evernote.com    mail &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;exchanger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;evernote.com    mail &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;exchanger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt; aspmx4.googlemail.com.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;evernote.com    mail &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;exchanger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt; aspmx5.googlemail.com.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;evernote.com    mail &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;exchanger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; aspmx.l.google.com.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Authoritative answers can be found from:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we can see here is a list of the different mail servers used by Evernote. In this case, they&amp;rsquo;re using Gmail, likely as part of Google&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gsuite.google.com/&#34;&gt;GSuite&lt;/a&gt; offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and copy the highest priority mail server, &lt;code&gt;aspmx.l.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, to your clipboard as we&amp;rsquo;ll be interrogating it shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-mail-server-windows&#34;&gt;Finding the mail server (Windows)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a Windows development person so I actually had to look up the Windows equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Powershell, there&amp;rsquo;s a cmdlet called &lt;code&gt;Resolve-DnsName&lt;/code&gt; that was surprisingly straight forward to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34; data-lang=&#34;powershell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;C:\Users\marcus.crane&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Resolve-DnsName&lt;/span&gt; -Type MX evernote.com

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As above, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to copy the mail server with the highest preference, which is &lt;code&gt;aspmx.l.google.com&lt;/code&gt; in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a diehard command prompt fan, or just don&amp;rsquo;t like/have access to Powershell, you can also get by using command prompt. It actually has a tool called &lt;code&gt;nslookup&lt;/code&gt; that comes with two modes: interactive and non-interactive. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a one liner to work so instead, we&amp;rsquo;ll just have to settle for the interactive mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;C:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;\U&lt;/span&gt;sers&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;\m&lt;/span&gt;arcus.crane&amp;gt;nslookup
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Default Server:  UnKnown
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Address:  192.168.1.1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;mx

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Address:  192.168.1.1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Non-authoritative answer:

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once more, &lt;code&gt;aspmx.l.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, the server with the highest preference is the one we&amp;rsquo;re after so copy it and keep it handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about nslookup for command prompt, I dug up &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/nslookup&#34;&gt;some documentation&lt;/a&gt; which lives under the section for Windows Server. Let me know if you figure out how to use nslookup in non-interactive mode!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;interrogatingwhispering-to-the-mail-server&#34;&gt;Interrogating/whispering to the mail server&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, got that mail server address handy? Now the party begins because from this point, the commands should be exactly the same across all major platforms with one quick caveat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows users? You&amp;rsquo;ll need to enable &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt; by searching for &amp;ldquo;Turn Windows features on or off&amp;rdquo;, ticking &lt;code&gt;Telnet Client&lt;/code&gt; and restarting to gain access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire up your terminal of choice and enter &lt;code&gt;telnet aspmx.l.google.com 25&lt;/code&gt;. This is where you&amp;rsquo;d substitute your own mail server if you were following along at home with a different domain. Still the same port 25 though since we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with SMTP no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; telnet aspmx.l.google.com &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trying 172.217.194.26...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Connected to aspmx.l.google.com.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Escape character is &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;^]&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;220&lt;/span&gt; mx.google.com ESMTP b26si1910042pgs.432 - gsmtp
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s not much to see besides a 200 code, meaning we&amp;rsquo;ve connected successfully. I feel like a lot of servers usually have a nice message like &amp;ldquo;hi&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;welcome&amp;rdquo; and I thought Google did too but I guess not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first step is to say hello to the server, which sounds like a joke but it&amp;rsquo;s not. Enter &lt;code&gt;helo hi&lt;/code&gt; and the server should greet you back like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; helo hi
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt; mx.google.com at your service
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve artificially inserted a prompt here to denote what I&amp;rsquo;ve entered but generally, telnet will have no such prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to say who the message is coming from. You can use your own email, or any email really. I like to use &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:test@example.com&#34;&gt;test@example.com&lt;/a&gt; because it&amp;rsquo;s a dummy email, but it also comes from a real domain name. If that sounds like news, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iana.org&#34;&gt;IANA&lt;/a&gt; provides example.com as a domain for use in &amp;ldquo;illustrative documents&amp;rdquo; like books. Anyway, we provide our identity like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; mail from: &amp;lt;test@example.com&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mail from: &amp;lt;test@example.com&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt; 2.1.0 OK b26si1910042pgs.432 - gsmtp
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see another &lt;code&gt;250&lt;/code&gt; response code followed by an &lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt; which means that the mail server has accepted. If someone went wrong, we&amp;rsquo;d see a 500 code. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten errors on rare occasions where I&amp;rsquo;ve used fake domain names so I just use example.com to play it safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, and where all our hard work pays off, is providing a recipient. This won&amp;rsquo;t actually send an email, it&amp;rsquo;ll just let us know if the address is real or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; rcpt to: &amp;lt;ian@evernote.com&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt; 2.1.5 OK b26si1910042pgs.432 - gsmtp
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rcpt to: &amp;lt;not.ian@evernote.com&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;550-5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist. Please try
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;550-5.1.1 double-checking the recipient&amp;#39;s email address &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; typos or
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;550-5.1.1 unnecessary spaces. Learn more at
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;550&lt;/span&gt; 5.1.1  https://support.google.com/mail/?p&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;NoSuchUser b26si1910042pgs.432 - gsmtp
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we can see, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:ian@evernote.com&#34;&gt;ian@evernote.com&lt;/a&gt; does indeed exist! We&amp;rsquo;d receive a 550 error if the user was invalid but there are often some catches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t always get it in the first go, or even necessarily have any leads on what the email structure looks like. All I can really suggest is brute force combinations until you get a response. If &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:ian@evernote.com&#34;&gt;ian@evernote.com&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;rsquo;t valid, my next step would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; rcpt to: &amp;lt;ian.small@evernote.com&amp;gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common formats are probably &lt;code&gt;first.name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;f.last&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flast&lt;/code&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can look up lists of common formats or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;common-gotchas&#34;&gt;Common gotchas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above usually works out for me most of the time but there&amp;rsquo;s a few different things I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed along the way that can throw a spanner in the works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blocked-ip-addresses&#34;&gt;Blocked IP addresses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one issue I came across while writing this post and it&amp;rsquo;s to do with mail servers that refer you to a block list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; telnet microsoft-com.mail.protection.outlook.com &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed it with websites that use Microsoft / Outlook primarily where it mentioned that your IP address, or perhaps your entire IP range, is banned and that you should visit a particular link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably this is because common home address ranges are blocked, as I imagine most spammers just operate from those same ranges. I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a solution for these cases unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;misleading-success-codes&#34;&gt;Misleading success codes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some SMTP servers are configured so that every address returns a success code meaning you can&amp;rsquo;t tell what exists and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; mail from: &amp;lt;test@example.com&amp;gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s not really any way around this other than sending a real email I suppose but you can test for it pretty easily. I like to use two emails, &lt;code&gt;postmaster&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;not.a.real.user&lt;/code&gt; first as a test to see what they return. By default, the large majority of mail servers, if not all, have a postmaster address by default so you can almost guarantee it exists. Likewise, you&amp;rsquo;d almost never create an address called not.a.real.user so it quickly lets you know if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be tricked when trying your actual target address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; mail from: &amp;lt;test@example.com&amp;gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-this-handy-for&#34;&gt;What is this handy for?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first came across this trick a few years back. I had been talking to someone about a job interview, before I was actually in the tech industry but I… forgot to ask them for their email address. I remembered their name but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how it was formatted exactly so that&amp;rsquo;s where this trick came in handy. It&amp;rsquo;s useful to have in your back pocket when you want to email a semi-public figure too like the CEO of a company. Just make sure to use it wisely and respectfully. You won&amp;rsquo;t make any friends by being malicious.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In which I turn 25 and look back over my writing hobby to date</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/25/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 6:30pm on my 25th birthday and I&amp;rsquo;ve been reflecting a bit on what I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to accomplish so far. While this isn&amp;rsquo;t a post about that, there&amp;rsquo;s no better time to assess the state of my personal site and where I&amp;rsquo;d like to go forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-current-state&#34;&gt;The current state&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, my blog isn&amp;rsquo;t really best effort. I&amp;rsquo;d like to write more things but I never really make it an actual goal. I&amp;rsquo;d say the biggest reason is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wrapped up in work side projects instead of my own personal side projects so I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking to stop doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My site has gone through plenty of iterations, with the current being a static site, built with Hugo and hosted on Netlify. It works but it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly how I&amp;rsquo;d like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, pages have disappeared. There used to be a projects page which never got filled in properly. There was also an archive of reviews I wrote years back. They&amp;rsquo;re still there but not publically exposed anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-id-like-to-get-to&#34;&gt;Where I&amp;rsquo;d like to get to&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always seem to fumble around a lot with Markdown. It works great but there&amp;rsquo;s always things missing I wish I had. Some markdown libraries support tables while some don&amp;rsquo;t, or defer to extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come across Asciidoc recently and it seems to be exactly what I&amp;rsquo;d like. Even as a general document format, it seems pretty handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo does have support for it, but it runs with some hardcoded flags that are annoying. It requires a Hugo heading block so you might get a mix like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;---
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;title: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;date: 2019-08-19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tags: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;---
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marcus Crane &amp;lt;marcus@utf9k.net&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;v1.0, 2019-08-19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It&amp;#39;s 6:30pm...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This works fine but I&amp;rsquo;d like to stick to just one single format. Mixing metadata just for Hugo and metadata just for Asciidoc is annoying so I&amp;rsquo;ll have a look into that. Asciidoc itself provides pretty much everything I&amp;rsquo;d want out the box for a static site. The remainder is just building the category pages and so on, which I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need a fully fledged framework for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-topics-id-like-to-look-into&#34;&gt;Some topics I&amp;rsquo;d like to look into&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a list of topics I sometimes keep handy but I haven&amp;rsquo;t invested much time into exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, there&amp;rsquo;s some stuff I&amp;rsquo;d like to write about and others I&amp;rsquo;d have to research. In no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A writeup of all the iterations of my site with pros and cons (eg; Django, Flask, Hugo, Jekyll etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comparison of &amp;ldquo;Prepay SMS UIs&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little while ago I changed cell providers (and then switched back). Topping up credit using SMS based menus was fascinating since it&amp;rsquo;s like this whole web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to model the various states you can get into and just talk about text based UIs in general&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there&amp;rsquo;d be some lessons from there that could be reused in chat based UIs or whatever the flavour of the month is with Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donating to those who are homeless / on the streets in the future&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With plenty of things moving to Paywave type technology, what will happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I rarely/never carry cash on me anymore so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t give spare change even if I wanted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own personal de-googlify post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently deleted my Google account after finding a replacement for YouTube (exported my subscriptions as an RSS feed)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most other services I had a replacement for, or never used them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently running LineageOS with a custom location provider so pretty much no reliance on Google stuff for Android&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One missing piece then I&amp;rsquo;d be ready to write about how it&amp;rsquo;s worked for (quite well actually)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not hardline &amp;ldquo;my freedoms&amp;rdquo; so I still run eg; Instagram and what not. The idea isn&amp;rsquo;t to be pure but find a balance between convenience and privacy (as much as that&amp;rsquo;s a thing hah)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github vs Gitlab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently imported some stuff to Gitlab. I haven&amp;rsquo;t invested much time into it but it seems promising given how many features they&amp;rsquo;ve developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They could all just be quite shallow and not very reliable however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing my &amp;ldquo;every day carry&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently managed to merge my keys, cards and public transport tag into one which has been working quite well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d always fancied the idea of not having a wallet but couldn&amp;rsquo;t really see how it would work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking mediums&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Us humans seem to be bad at picking mediums. We do tweetstorms about political policy or complex issues rather than doing long form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, shorter mediums are popular but the medium itself shapes the content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fit eg; Twitter&amp;rsquo;s message size, you&amp;rsquo;re going to simplify ideas as much as you can (but no more) but nuance may get lost in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-things-to-add&#34;&gt;Other things to add&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proper projects page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got some stuff I can probably put up but it would also give me a reason to focus on personal projects more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring back the reviews page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to have something (automation idk) embed cover art and what not for reviews so they look a bit more official&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a stats page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to have this at one point which would pull information from various places&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a nice excuse to play around with technology I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with like Redis or Celery queues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the whole dynamic vs static thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of me wants to go back to dynamic all the time as an excuse to learn new technologies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a mix of the two is would suit me best. Just use asciidoc (via a subprocess) to render pages / store them statically while dynamically building the list type pages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-get-there&#34;&gt;How do I get there&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just gotta start leaving my laptop at work or else I get tempted to work on work technologies honestly. None of the above is hard but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get side tracked or want to finish off something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, there&amp;rsquo;s no requirement for me to do so. Things just happen to cross over with my interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this post is me committing to changing that, and also having a list of things to look into before I forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we&amp;rsquo;ll do a 26 this time next year. On that note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Some final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is essentially my portfolio but I don&amp;rsquo;t care to make it particularly professional. The style is &amp;ldquo;Things past me would enjoy stumbling upon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there may be some posts about specialised topics, none of them should be sacred and should attempt to be readable by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s that scale that tells you if text is at a 3rd grade reading level etc. That could be an interesting thing to run over some posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely look at analytics. They don&amp;rsquo;t have any bearing on what I write. Comments I don&amp;rsquo;t mind but they&amp;rsquo;re not really integrated well. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get rid of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like the site to be a bit more nice to look at. I tried the whole dark scheme for a bit and it&amp;rsquo;s good but not quite perfect. Maybe I even support both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference books seem to have some cool layouts. I could probably pull some inspiration from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen out of love with menus. If I do have then, breadcrumb style things might be a way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to look back in a few years and see a bunch of stuff that reflects who I was, and how much I know, at that point in time. That&amp;rsquo;s partly why having a format that lasts is important since Hugo may disappear one day for all I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Retrieving credentials from Jenkins</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/retrieving-jenkins-credentials/</link>
      <description>If you&#39;ve put your secrets in Jenkins, there is a sneaky backdoor to get them out again</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/retrieving-jenkins-credentials/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever stored a password in Jenkins, only to forget later on what the value is? You might try logging it from inside an existing job, but you&amp;rsquo;ll find that Jenkins goes out of its way to mask that value from you (and any potential attackers!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a sneaky way to get those credentials out of a Jenkins agent that requires only a little bit of wrangling. It may be possible to lock this down, I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked, so it&amp;rsquo;s good to be aware of it, in order to consider the security implications too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the password you want to get your hands on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;01-credential-view.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Jenkins UI. It is showing the credentials section. It depicts a password entry called &amp;amp;lsquo;My super secret password&amp;amp;rsquo; although no actual credentials are visible.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;code&gt;Update&lt;/code&gt; which will show you an obscured version of the secret&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;02-credential-update.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Jenkins UI progressed from the previous image. Metadata about the selected credential are visible such as scope, ID and description. There is a secret field but it just contains dots like any normal password field does, rather than the actual password text.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right click on the &lt;code&gt;Secret&lt;/code&gt; field and hit &lt;code&gt;Inspect Element&lt;/code&gt; to bring up the developer tools for your browser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;03-inspect-element.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Jenkins UI. The user has right clicked on the secret field of the credential metadata. Their browser context menu is visible, invoked by right clicking. The &amp;amp;lsquo;Inspect Element&amp;amp;rsquo; item is highlighted but not yet clicked.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either right click on the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; part of the input field, or double click on the value area and copy the wonky looking hash. It&amp;rsquo;ll be surrounded with braces eg; &lt;code&gt;{ABC123=}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;04-credential-hash.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Firefox browser tools. The user has found the DOM node for the redacted input in the element selector pane. They have right clicked it, bringing up the browser context menu and have highlighted &amp;amp;lsquo;Copy attribute value&amp;amp;rsquo; under the &amp;amp;lsquo;Attributes&amp;amp;rsquo; submenu.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that value in your clipboard, go to &lt;code&gt;/script&lt;/code&gt; eg; &lt;code&gt;https://jenkins.example.com/script&lt;/code&gt; or from the homepage, visit &lt;code&gt;Manage Jenkins -&amp;gt; Script Console&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;05-script-console.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Jenkins UI. It shows the &amp;amp;lsquo;Script Console&amp;amp;rsquo; page which lives under /script by default.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the following into the script console: &lt;code&gt;println(hudson.util.Secret.decrypt(&#39;&amp;lt;paste hash here&amp;gt;&#39;))&lt;/code&gt;. Make sure to include the braces and the single quotes. You should see your credential output as seen below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;06-final-result.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Jenkins Script Console UI. The user has pasted the copied input from the Firefox browser tools that was open in an earlier screenshot. This input has been wrapped in some Jenkins functions. Below the Script Console is an output area with the actual password of the credential that was previously redacted.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty handy trick, but quite obviously a borderline exploit at the same time. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to use it responsibly!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fixing a WSL2 VHD conversion issue</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/wsl2-vhd-issue/</link>
      <description>One night I had a bit to drink and debugged the hell out of a WSL2 issue out of frustration</description>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/wsl2-vhd-issue/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently started running the Windows Insider builds on my desktop so that I could play around with the new Windows Subsystem for Linux but I ran into some trouble. Before I get into the fix, here&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of history&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-history&#34;&gt;The history&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the unfamiliar, it&amp;rsquo;s a way to run Linux applications inside of a Windows environment using a lightweight VM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the familiar, you may have heard of WSL 1, which essentially translated Linux system calls into their appropriate NT kernel counterparts. The downside meant that things were kind of slow, and not everything worked as you would hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest downside was perhaps USB devices, in that there were no drivers to support them. Personally, I was unable to use the Yubikey NEO I had at the time, given that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1521&#34;&gt;smart cards had no support&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone using USB debug interfaces such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/2185&#34;&gt;JTAG&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/2195&#34;&gt;ADB&lt;/a&gt; was out of luck too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, this should hopefully be in the past now with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/announcing-wsl-2&#34;&gt;announcement of WSL 2&lt;/a&gt;, a virtual machine that&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be so light, it&amp;rsquo;s not like those other slow virtual machines you think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fix&#34;&gt;The fix&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I dove in by following the installation instructions and hit a brick wall once I got to the second step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34; data-lang=&#34;powershell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;C:\WINDOWS\system32&amp;gt; wsl --set-version Ubuntu &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conversion &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; progress, this may take a few minutes...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;For&lt;/span&gt; information on key differences with WSL &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; please visit https://aka.ms/wsl2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system limitation.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Virtual hard disk files must be uncompressed and unencrypted and must not be sparse.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon trying to convert my WSL distros to Version 2, they complained about a virtual disk system limitation. I actually put this on the backburner for months until coming back to it today and the fix felt dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;d never know it but your WSL packages live under &lt;code&gt;%LOCALAPPDATA%/packages/&amp;lt;distro title surrounded by nonsense&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. In my case, Debian lives at &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\Marcus\AppData\Local\Packages\TheDebianProject.DebianGNULinux_76v4gfsz19hv4&lt;/code&gt;. If you visit your distro&amp;rsquo;s respective folder, you&amp;rsquo;ll find no virtual disk image in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms &amp;ldquo;uncompressed and unencrypted&amp;rdquo; tipped me off to check those blasted &amp;ldquo;advanced settings&amp;rdquo;. Under &lt;code&gt;Right Click -&amp;gt; Properties -&amp;gt; General -&amp;gt; Advanced&lt;/code&gt;, I spotted &lt;code&gt;Compress contents to save disk space&lt;/code&gt; was ticked for some reason. Unchecking it, then rerunning the WSL 1 -&amp;gt; 2 conversion worked as you&amp;rsquo;d hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;compressed.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot showing Windows Explorer. It is open to C:/Users/Marcus/AppData/Local/Packages. A folder is highlighted to indicate it was recently clicked on. The properties window for that folder is visible showing metadata. Overlaying the properties window is the Advanced Attributes window where a checkbox labelled &amp;amp;lsquo;Compress contents to save disk space&amp;amp;rsquo; is checked. The author is showing that you should uncheck that box to fix the issue described in this post.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you run into this issue, have a poke around your packages and hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll be on your way to a nice, properly Linux-y home on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is the future of emergency services?</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/future-of-emergency-services/</link>
      <description>It&#39;s surprising that the idea of an emergency service is even viable, considering how many people are doing things at any given time</description>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/future-of-emergency-services/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I had an onset of severe abdominal pains. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to overreact so I called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/services-and-support/health-care-services/healthline&#34;&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt; who recommended I see either my GP, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department&#34;&gt;A&amp;amp;E&lt;/a&gt; within the next 6 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after I hung up, I had a pain spike bad enough to make me burst into tears. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting anywhere clutching my stomach on the floor so I called an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An operator took my information, said that someone would be on their way and then hung up. I waited… and waited… Just over an hour passed before I gave up and called an Uber. One just happened to be 2 minutes away, with the entire trip only taking about 10 minutes from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of me worried they had turned up only to find me not there so I called back and asked to have the request cancelled. They did so and I asked what the state of the callout was only to find that nothing was ever dispatched due to a high callout rate in my area. Presumably based on my age and the symptoms, they figured I was at low risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t leave me with a good feeling or sense of security but it did get me wondering about two things: Statistics and the future of emergency services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this article would likely have been joking about how there will probably be &amp;ldquo;Uber for Ambulances&amp;rdquo; as I often have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;new startup idea: uber for ambulances. cheaper rates than a normal ambulance unless rugby is on then it&amp;rsquo;s 6x surge prices or you&amp;rsquo;re fucked — &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sentreh&#34;&gt;@sentreh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/upshot/uber-lyft-and-the-urgency-of-saving-money-on-ambulances.html&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/taking-uber-lyft-emergency-room-legal-liabilities&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; writeups about how patients are using ridesharing services in place of ambulances and I think I understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.ku.edu/~kuwpaper/2017Papers/201708.pdf&#34;&gt;This non-peer reviewed paper&lt;/a&gt; in particular, from the University of Kansas, noted an 8% decline in ambulance callouts following the launch of Uber in each respective city measured in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now having said all this, there was actually an announcement this time last year for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-health/&#34;&gt;Uber Health&lt;/a&gt; in the US. The service is more for booking health-related rides on behalf of patients, as opposed to straight up replacing ambulances but give it enough time and I could see that extra capacity being leveraged to fill in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second question, and one that I&amp;rsquo;m not really qualified to answer, is to do with the actual callout rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_New_Zealand&#34;&gt;St John&lt;/a&gt; Organisation are the primary dispatcher of ambulances in New Zealand, providing emergency services to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stjohn.org.nz/What-we-do/St-John-Ambulance-Services/&#34;&gt;nearly 90% of New Zealanders&lt;/a&gt; according to their own website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a handy &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stjohn.org.nz/News--Info/Our-Performance/Response-Times/&#34;&gt;section on response times&lt;/a&gt; which links to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.health.govt.nz/new-zealand-health-system/key-health-sector-organisations-and-people/naso-national-ambulance-sector-office/emergency-ambulance-services-eas/performance-quality-and-safety/emergency-ambulance-service-national-performance-reports&#34;&gt;Ministry of Health&amp;rsquo;s Emergency Ambulance Service national performance reports&lt;/a&gt;. Look a bit closer and you&amp;rsquo;ll see &amp;ldquo;For information about St John’s performance visit the performance section of their web site.&amp;rdquo; which just leads us back to where we started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, their annual reports contain some of the information we&amp;rsquo;re after. Let&amp;rsquo;s take the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stjohn.org.nz/globalassets/documents/publications/annual-report/stj-annual-report_2018_lq.pdf&#34;&gt;2018 Annual report&lt;/a&gt; as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we jump all the way to Page 50, we can see a breakdown of numbers with 533,669 ambulance emergency calls made. Another line item mentions 480,411 patients treated or transported by ambulance officers. If we were to very roughly assume that 1 call correlated with 1 patient, that would leave 53,258 calls that are never responded to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously that&amp;rsquo;s not the whole picture. One call could be for a car crash with multiple injuries while the already deceased may not be counted as &amp;ldquo;Patients treated or transported&amp;rdquo;. Similarly, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take into account prank calls, duplicate calls and no-show patients who can&amp;rsquo;t cancel callouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, I think it still does point out that there&amp;rsquo;s likely a chunk of callouts that never get responded to as a result of unstaffing combined with ever increasing callout numbers. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty dystopian having something like the &amp;ldquo;Gig Economy&amp;rdquo; acting as a replacement for essential services but I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ll take what I can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, I never liked the attention that came with flashing lights and sirens anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recovering lost Python results in the REPL</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/lost-python-results/</link>
      <description>Did you know that Python stores the previous output as a hidden variable?</description>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was messing around with some queuing earlier today in order to try out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/celery/kombu&#34;&gt;Kombu&lt;/a&gt; library. It works pretty nicely but I goofed up while playing with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add a message to a queue, it looks a little like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; kombu &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Connection, Queue
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;conn &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Connection() &lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Defaults to a RabbitMQ Docker container I have running locally&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;queue &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; conn&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;SimpleQueue(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;test&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;queue&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;put(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;this is a message i want to put on the queue&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to use a context manager instead but for a simple test, this works fine. Now then, how about getting a message off the queue? It&amp;rsquo;s straight forward as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;queue&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;get()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# &amp;lt;Message object at 0x110a844c8 with details {&amp;#39;state&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;RECEIVED&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;content_type&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;text/plain&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;delivery_tag&amp;#39;: 1, &amp;#39;body_length&amp;#39;: 5, &amp;#39;properties&amp;#39;: {}, &amp;#39;delivery_info&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;exchange&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;test&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;routing_key&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;test&amp;#39;}}&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cool, we&amp;rsquo;ve received a message now so next we need to acknowledge it with the ack function…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute, we forgot to save that message to a variable so how the hell can we acknowledge it?! Damn, it&amp;rsquo;s totally just lost in memory, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a scenario I ran into and it got me wondering: Is it possible to retrieve a Python object by that hex/memory address? Well, it turns out that you can&amp;rsquo;t. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a deep dive yet but if it&amp;rsquo;s a continuously running application, it may soon exit memory and be lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re just running in the Python REPL however, there is actually a way: The handy &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# &amp;lt;Message object at 0x110a844c8 with details {&amp;#39;state&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;RECEIVED&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;content_type&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;text/plain&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;delivery_tag&amp;#39;: 1, &amp;#39;body_length&amp;#39;: 5, &amp;#39;properties&amp;#39;: {}, &amp;#39;delivery_info&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;exchange&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;test&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;routing_key&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;test&amp;#39;}}&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;_&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ack()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# &amp;lt;Message object at 0x110a844c8 with details {&amp;#39;state&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;ACK&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;content_type&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;text/plain&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;delivery_tag&amp;#39;: 1, &amp;#39;body_length&amp;#39;: 5, &amp;#39;properties&amp;#39;: {}, &amp;#39;delivery_info&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;exchange&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;test&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;routing_key&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;test&amp;#39;}}&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;message &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; _
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(message)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# &amp;lt;Message object at 0x110a844c8 with details {&amp;#39;state&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;ACK&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;content_type&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;text/plain&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;delivery_tag&amp;#39;: 1, &amp;#39;body_length&amp;#39;: 5, &amp;#39;properties&amp;#39;: {}, &amp;#39;delivery_info&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;exchange&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;test&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;routing_key&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;test&amp;#39;}}&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the interpreter actually binds the last result to the &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; character. If you were to do &lt;code&gt;1 + 1&lt;/code&gt;, the value of &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; would be 2! You can also bind the value to a variable for use later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d need it often but it&amp;rsquo;s very handy to know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When automation goes horribly right</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/automation-right/</link>
      <description>What do you do when a UI element disappears but the service powering it still persists?</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/automation-right/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I finally solved an issue that has been a pain in my ass for many months: successful automation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the latter end of 2016, Twitter announced a new suite of tools for businesses via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.twitter.com/marketing/en_us/topics/product-news/2016/speed-up-customer-service-with-quick-replies-welcome-messages.html&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. There were a bunch of things from quick replies to profile-listed support hours which I&amp;rsquo;m sure were of some use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the latter but I also enabled &amp;ldquo;welcome messages&amp;rdquo;: automated replies that would trigger when a &amp;ldquo;customer&amp;rdquo; opened your direct messages. In my case, I&amp;rsquo;m not a business so it was more just some silliness to add to my profile and it confused a few people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;confusion-one.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of a Twitter direct message. On the left is an automated message from the user. It reads &amp;amp;ldquo;Hey there, lease a message after the beep. This has been an automated message&amp;amp;rdquo;. On the right is a reply from a surprised user who asks how the automated message was created.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, I&amp;rsquo;d forget that I had it enabled and then someone else would get caught out by it a few months later&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;confusion-two.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of a Twitter direct message, many months after the one just shown previously. On the left are some messages expressing surprise at having found an automated response. On the right is the author expressing confusion, due to having forgot any such automated messages exist.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;and then it kept going at which point it started becoming a bit of a nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;confusion-three.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of a Twitter direct message. On the left is a user saying that the automated messaging is still intact. On the right is the author, typing in full capital letters to express disbelief, stating that they have tried to turn off this automated feature but can&amp;amp;rsquo;t figure out how.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, I was particularly annoyed and attempted to turn it off. I clearly remembered that there was a dashboard but do you think I could find it? That would be too easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can actually see a walkthrough of that very page right &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/H-n0hRO7oLk?t=75&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but good luck finding it because it was actually removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe it. I just figured I had forgotten how to navigate to it but every month, I&amp;rsquo;d try once again to track it down with no luck. Eventually, I just resigned myself to the fact that some automation was running somewhere inside Twitter and I could never turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things changed. I started a new job as a Site Reliability Engineer funnily enough. I would laugh to myself whenever we discussed service availability. Inevitably, it would come up that Google has planned outages in order to keep downstream providers on their toes and not overly reliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wished so hard that Twitter would have a planned outage but no, apparently this microservice, or whatever it was, never failed. It was perfect and never toppled. Seriously, give those developers a pat on the back because I wanted nothing more than to take a baseball bat to the entire fucking cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just simply call Twitter and ask them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today and once more, a confused friend simply messaged me &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to ask. Whatever this automation was, it never really seemed consistent either. Those who I talked to often would suddenly receive an automated response out of nowhere. Not that I could tell since it wasn&amp;rsquo;t me talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I stumbled onto the Twitter Developer forum and… ah! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twittercommunity.com/t/defunct-business-auto-dm-feature-no-longer-editable-and-still-sends/116561&#34;&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone!&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m not crazy! Someone else remembers this thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of confusion, it was cleared up that the Twitter API has a section for &amp;ldquo;welcome messages&amp;rdquo; which are these very same automated snippets. Using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/twitter/twurl&#34;&gt;twurl&lt;/a&gt;, a Twitter-modified version of curl, I could view those darn things finally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;welcome-messages.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of a Windows terminal. A command has been run and the image depicts the output. The command is a utility called twurl and a GET request is being made to the welcome_messages API endpoint. The output shows a list with one item which is the automated message that this post has been describing. The nightmare is finally over.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There they were. Sitting within the API the whole time although I&amp;rsquo;d guess that feature was only documented as part of the recent overhaul of Twitter&amp;rsquo;s developer APIs. Even the original URL, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dashboard.twitter.com&#34;&gt;dashboard.twitter.com&lt;/a&gt;, doesn&amp;rsquo;t resolve anymore which is all the proof I needed that I&amp;rsquo;d been left out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some copy paste magic, I quickly wiped the slate clean. I was free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally awake from that god awful nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twitter Business Experience was definitely just that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That just leaves one last question: if it took me many months to fix this problem, what hope do those actual businesses who signed up have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess you get the support you pay for, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A brief guide to OIAs in New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/nz-oia-guide/</link>
      <description>My extremely brief crash course in the Official Information Act and how it can be used for some interesting civic side projects</description>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/nz-oia-guide/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was browsing &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week and came across an interesting post called &lt;a href=&#34;http://mchap.io/using-foia-data-and-unix-to-halve-major-source-of-parking-tickets.html&#34;&gt;Using FOIA Data and Unix to halve major source of parking tickets&lt;/a&gt;. As you can imagine, the post is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Does_exactly_what_it_says_on_the_tin&#34;&gt;exactly what it says on the tin&lt;/a&gt; and got me inspired to do some own data wrangling of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, a coworker got a parking ticket and I was reminded of that post so I told them the story. They seemed to think it was a neat idea but didn&amp;rsquo;t have a great understanding of the Official Information Act process. I mean, just look at that name! It sounds all legal and fancy but really, it&amp;rsquo;s actually very straight forward (and arguably kinda fun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m no expert myself but I can at least show you where to start. I actually have a yearly FOIA request I make but I&amp;rsquo;ll save that story for the end of this post. Now, onward!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-caveats&#34;&gt;Some caveats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that while this guide is specifically aimed at New Zealanders, some of the tips can possibly apply to your own country. I should note that New Zealand is ranked #1 in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transparency.org/country/NZL&#34;&gt;Transparency International&amp;rsquo;s Corruption Perception Index&lt;/a&gt; so as you can imagine, there&amp;rsquo;s generally no hassle with requesting information from our government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that a less transparent, or even citizen-hostile government is going to be an entirely different kettle of fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-information-what&#34;&gt;Official Information what?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, right. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of the term FOIA or OIA but haven&amp;rsquo;t really got an idea of what it is or where the ability originates from. Is it a service granted from the kindness of our governmental overlords? Hah! Well… it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Official Information Act of 1982, readable &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/DLM64785.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, is actually a replacement for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/osa19511951n77183/&#34;&gt;Official Secrets Act 1951&lt;/a&gt;. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I was aware of it before writing this post but sharing government information was a criminal offense! Wikipedia only mentions this in passing but after digging a bit, I believe the particular section that applied was 6(1)(a). You can see it below although I&amp;rsquo;ve cut out some bits so it&amp;rsquo;s not just a huge wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) If any person, having in his possession or control … any sketch, plan, model, article, note, document, or information … which has been entrusted in confidence to him by any person holding office under His Majesty or under the Government of any other country, or which he has obtained or to which he has had access owing to his position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) Communicates the code word, password, sketch, plan, model, article, note, document, or information to any person, other than a person to whom he is authorized to communicate it … he commits an offence against this Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Section 6 (1), New Zealand Official Secrets Act 1951&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of information belonging to &amp;ldquo;the Queen and her advisors&amp;rdquo; slowly seemed like a bunch of nonsense and as a result, the Official Information Act was born. In short, it allows anyone present in New Zealand (citizen or visitor) to request, surprise, information from any government Minister, department or organization. That&amp;rsquo;s basically all it boils down to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-i-request&#34;&gt;What can I request?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, there&amp;rsquo;s no limit on what you can request but as with most parts of life, just because you ask doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you shall receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some cases where the requestee can deny your request but it has to be justified. Specifically, Section 6(a) through (e) outlines acceptable reasons for dismissing your request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) to prejudice the security or defence of New Zealand or the international relations of the Government of New Zealand; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) to prejudice the entrusting of information to the Government of New Zealand on a basis of confidence by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— (i) the Government of any other country or any agency of such a Government; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— (ii) any international organisation; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) to prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and the right to a fair trial; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(d) to endanger the safety of any person; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(e) to damage seriously the economy of New Zealand by disclosing prematurely decisions to change or continue government economic or financial policies relating to—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— (i) exchange rates or the control of overseas exchange transactions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— (ii) the regulation of banking or credit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— (iii) taxation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— (iv) the stability, control, and adjustment of prices of goods and services, rents, and other costs, and rates of wages, salaries, and other incomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— (v) the borrowing of money by the Government of New Zealand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— (vi) the entering into of overseas trade agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-to-make-a-request-the-hard-secret-way&#34;&gt;Where to make a request (the hard, secret way)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you want to learn a thing or two, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need to know two things: who you want to contact (even roughly) and what you want to ask them. It seems obvious but if your request is too vague, or wide reaching, you&amp;rsquo;ll likely be asked to be more specific. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget, each request is painstakingly completed by a civil servant so they can&amp;rsquo;t shift mountains or compile impossible requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve got a goal in mind, the next step is just to contact the agency in question. As noted in Part 2, Section 12(1AA)(a), your request can take any form, whether it be a letter, email or even just verbally. Generally, email is the way to go however so just look up the website for your agency of choice and they should have a page for OIA requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: a Google Search for &lt;code&gt;ministry of justice oia&lt;/code&gt; brings up their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.justice.govt.nz/about/official-information-act-requests/&#34;&gt;OIA request page&lt;/a&gt;. It should be as straight forward as following the instructions from there. Some agencies, such as NZ Police, may ask for proof of citizenship in certain cases as I understand but you&amp;rsquo;ll likely not run into that issue. Similarly, some agencies may charge for very large requests but as I understand, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly rare for that to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-to-make-a-request-the-easy-public-way&#34;&gt;Where to make a request (the easy, public way)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s actually an easier way to make OIA requests thanks to the fine folks over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://fyi.org.nz&#34;&gt;FYI.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;. Simply pick an agency, fill in your request and the rest is sorted from there. Your request is given a page, not unlike a forum thread, and responses show up when they come back. Other users can give you advice if they think the response you got was crap and you&amp;rsquo;ll also be given the option to forward your response to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/&#34;&gt;Ombudsman&lt;/a&gt; should you choose to dispute it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only catch is that all requests are public, so as to cut down on duplicate requests. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, none of your information is public, just your first name. The initial query, and any replies you send, are sent through FYI&amp;rsquo;s own email address which acts as a middle man on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to do a project surrounding public utilities, persuing past requests can be a great way to get ideas on what sort of information you could request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-requests-have-you-done&#34;&gt;What requests have you done?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, the guide itself is over but I have a bit of a fun story that you might like to use as inspiration yourself. Earlier, I mentioned Section 6 which outlines reasons that agencies can reject your requests. There&amp;rsquo;s a few requests on FYI that have been rejected or redacted under those grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occured to me one day. While I can&amp;rsquo;t even know what that redacted information was, I can at least know what the information related to. A sort of metadata if you like so I did exactly that. Below is a table of topics. The NZ government has had requests for information that surrounded those topics. The requests were either rejected, or more likely redacted. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting list, and probably about what I would guess to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view a table I keep updated with these requests &lt;a href=&#34;/projects/meta-oia-requests&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick glance tells that the majority of rejected/redacted requests were on the grounds of defense or ensuring international relations which is understandable. Additionally, the NZ government have been entrusted with information from Australian officials regarding social security and from the US administration. None of those are particularly surprising but it&amp;rsquo;s still interesting nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear what those US Film Industry interactions were about myself. Perhaps with time, I can &amp;ldquo;FOIA the fuck out of it&amp;rdquo; to quote a tweet I saw earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Humans don&#39;t come with lore tabs</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/lore-tabs/</link>
      <description>Stories are fascinating but speed running them is a recipe for trouble</description>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/lore-tabs/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post has been a long time coming because I&amp;rsquo;ve never really known how to express it. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I can write it properly anyway but I&amp;rsquo;m going to at least try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently started the Xero Graduate Programme which has been amazing! As with any new position, it inevitably involves meeting a lot of new people for the first time. I&amp;rsquo;m not really here to talk about the program itself which is a story for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m purely talking about my own experiences struggling to interact with people properly. I figure by writing about it, even if I should fail to improve as a result, you&amp;rsquo;ll at least have an insight to how some people struggle with this kinda stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often feel like I&amp;rsquo;m stuck in a recurring loop where I&amp;rsquo;ll meet someone that I consider to be not only interesting, but worth knowing, and so I decide &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d like to know more about this person&amp;rdquo;. I mean, we all do it but the more I consider my past approaches, I&amp;rsquo;ve realised that I was digging for lore first, rather than getting to properly know the person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean? Well, let me take a step back and explain what lore is. It&amp;rsquo;s a term that is found commonly in fictional universes such as TV series, games, comics, movies and so on. If the story and character progression of a TV series is the plot, then lore is the mythos of the characters and its world. Past battles, heroic struggles, craters left where cities once stood, ancient texts left by those past and so on. Obviously I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting that your average person is supposed to be some kind of otherworldly being but the point is, humans don&amp;rsquo;t have lore tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean is that you can&amp;rsquo;t, and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, be able to just learn about someone in an instant. Game of Thrones is likely a popular example of this. I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched it but I know that if I were to start, I could pour over its wiki and spend hours learning about cities, people, kingdoms, tribes and so on. For years, humans have been fascinated by good stories and lore, no matter the medium it takes, is probably the purest concentration of stories past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual humans - living people - may have good stories and interesting tales but you can&amp;rsquo;t just skip to the last page and find out what happens to your favourite character. At some point, you might consider learning a lot about someone would make you a better friend because you can understand their nuances. Learning what makes them tick may allow you to adapt but friendships aren&amp;rsquo;t the result of studying someone&amp;rsquo;s past. Funnily enough, they&amp;rsquo;re the result of being a part of someone&amp;rsquo;s past, which can only be done by being in the present. Ironic since it&amp;rsquo;s almost putting the two backwards but in a sense, that&amp;rsquo;s what I had been doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What leads someone to think like that? I&amp;rsquo;ve been mulling over this lately because almost all of us act out the same pattern to an extent. Biographies, literally the story of others, are a popular book category while Wikipedia has detailed articles on any celebrity you can imagine. They&amp;rsquo;re still people too like you and me so where do you draw the line? Heck, the sheer scale of public information shared by society makes it easier than ever before to scope out someone&amp;rsquo;s past. We&amp;rsquo;re the most documented group of humans in history, essentially recording our autobiographies in real time. The only deciding factor I can up with has to be intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not what it used to be but I remembered a post from Lifehacker that I read back when, geez, I must&amp;rsquo;ve been about 14 at the time? The author was talking about Last.FM. The short of it is that you can &amp;ldquo;scrobble&amp;rdquo; music you listen to. It just records a song as listened to once you&amp;rsquo;ve hit, say 80% of the song played. Over time, you can view a history of your favourite artists, get recommendations and generally just share your taste in music. The post was talking about the Last.FM service, and specifically how the author had noted their friend would scrobble happy tracks on a good day and vice versa when things were looking bleak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their friend was inadvertently letting on to how they truly felt without possibly giving it a second thought. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t track down the original post which is probably long gone but the author noted how it enabled them to be a better friend to an extent. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain that was actually the day I signed up for the service and I still use it to this day. Spotify and other popular services still have native integrations built into their clients. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s obvious but the same never happened for me. Who could expect such a thing with so much content floating around. Even if someone did have a look, you&amp;rsquo;d have to be consciously looking for patterns anyway. If I can&amp;rsquo;t be lucky enough to have someone who thinks like that, surely I can be that person for someone else, right? The intention is good so what could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most things that get out of hand, this all started small and with the best of intentions. I&amp;rsquo;ve got two past examples that quickly spiraled in different directions. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave them up for you to decide what&amp;rsquo;s good, bad and in between. Sometimes things are never so clear cut, especially in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once was getting ready for a date and I was quite excited! It&amp;rsquo;s not often that I set them up and when I do, I try to put in my best efforts. I was stood up and left very confused. Not only that, I was blocked on every conceivable platform for no obvious reason. I know it&amp;rsquo;s often said but I genuinely didn&amp;rsquo;t get it. I should&amp;rsquo;ve shrugged it off but it kept eating away at me until I decided I needed to find out just to get over it. Back to what I said about biographies, she&amp;rsquo;d had a YouTube channel with a public view history. Roughly 30% of the views she watched were themed around dealing with anxiety. Part of me wish I had known that earlier so I could have been more accomodating if that&amp;rsquo;s what she needed but context matters. Here was a relative stranger that I have no right to know any more than she lets on personally. I still feel bad for her honestly even though I was the one who got burnt. Were they bad actions to take even though they had good intentions? I honestly can&amp;rsquo;t say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was scrolling my timeline one night and came across a tweet from a teenager. He&amp;rsquo;d claimed to have just swallowed an entire bottle of medicine in a suicide attempt that he desperately wanted to undo. Rounding up an online acquaintance, we put our cursed skills to work as quick as we could. From little more than a username, we narrowed him down to a first name, nationality, gender, age estimate and state. Unfortunately it wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough specific enough that any authorities would be able to put it to use but he did end up surviving. I had previously sent him a message reassuring him since he&amp;rsquo;d disappeared offline but I never got a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s still active to this day I believe but understandably, two strangers digging up your information can be disconcering no matter the circumstance. I still feel bad about the situation, despite the outcome. As you comb through those forum posts, abandoned IRC logs and tweets, you begin to feel like you understand the person. You can almost picture how they&amp;rsquo;re thinking by what they say, and even more crucially, what they don&amp;rsquo;t. It&amp;rsquo;s like you know the person for a brief moment only to remember it&amp;rsquo;s a one way screen and they could give less of a shit about you despite the attempt. Good actions? Good intent? What&amp;rsquo;s the difference? They&amp;rsquo;re essentially the same story, right but they feel different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of this little exercise, and this post as a whole? The big picture of it is that realistically, what I&amp;rsquo;ve just described is a problem. I often have a problem with getting to properly know people. I&amp;rsquo;m great at learning who someone is but generally at a distance. If a group of friends are the main cast, I&amp;rsquo;m one of the extras in the background. Honestly, I probably don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m worthy enough to be promoted to a main character in this scenario because I often struggle to see it happening. I was recently at a meetup and I felt painfully like the odd one out. You can almost read the indifference in some people&amp;rsquo;s face when you talk to them. If I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt anything over the last few years, it&amp;rsquo;s that I think I&amp;rsquo;ll always cope better being picky with this sort of stuff. Sometimes I try to be friendly and seemingly the other party gets the wrong impression that I have some kind of motive. To steal a quote from Wargames, it often feels like the only winning move is not to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever read Dale Carnegie&amp;rsquo;s How to Win Friends and Influence People, then good on you because I haven&amp;rsquo;t. In the book, he comes to the conclusion that for others to take a genuine interest in you, it takes little more than being interested in them. The more you ask questions of others, the more interesting they will apparently find you. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s true, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say but lately I feel like mystery might be a common thread. Looking back, some of the more interesting people I&amp;rsquo;ve met have been quite illusive. That is to say, they&amp;rsquo;re never around. At that point, I have to wonder though if it&amp;rsquo;s the absence generates the mystery or if being a wanted person generates the absence. Perhaps one feeds the other and the secret is to just not give a shit and purposely be unavailable. Just rarely look at notifications and struggle to keep appointments. Slowly disappear from view until you&amp;rsquo;re all but forgotten. I&amp;rsquo;m joking of course but I wonder if there&amp;rsquo;s something to be learnt from those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, what have we learnt? Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve basically admitted that I may or may not be an awful person depending on how you&amp;rsquo;ve felt after taking this lengthy journey. Odds are that you&amp;rsquo;ve already made up your mind well before now if we&amp;rsquo;ve met before. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ve gained some insight into the meta of dealing with other people. I suppose this kind of thing comes naturally but I feel like I missed a memo somewhere. Either way, the first step is admitting something is wrong. Once you do that, hopefully it should be more straightfoward to progress and become a better person. Perhaps you can let me know how I get on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you&amp;rsquo;ll excuse me, I have to go and return some videotapes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Thoughts upon entering my first proper job in the industry</description>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/day-xero/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Technically it&amp;rsquo;s Day 1 of my new job, a Graduate Site Reliability Engineer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xero.com/nz/&#34;&gt;Xero&lt;/a&gt; but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t officially started since I&amp;rsquo;m still on my way to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told myself that when I finally got my first full time development position, I&amp;rsquo;d write a big post mortem about how long it took, how many times I was rejected and all that but since I haven&amp;rsquo;t (yet), this is my offering to the Content Overlords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t even know if I actually slept last night because it felt like most of it was like &amp;ldquo;Oh no, what have I actually learnt over the last year&amp;rdquo; and other rude things from that pesky doubtful voice we all have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excuse me, you silly voice, I&amp;rsquo;ll have you know that I&amp;rsquo;ve used and/or fiddled with ahem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docker.com/&#34;&gt;doc&lt;/a&gt;hi&lt;a href=&#34;https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/&#34;&gt;ask&lt;/a&gt;ydd4h&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/&#34;&gt;py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.djangoproject.com/&#34;&gt;dja&lt;/a&gt;22hf&lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/en/&#34;&gt;nod&lt;/a&gt;j2ve&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npmjs.com/&#34;&gt;n&lt;/a&gt;a43&lt;a href=&#34;https://reactjs.org/&#34;&gt;rea&lt;/a&gt;f&lt;a href=&#34;https://webpack.js.org/&#34;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt;tex&lt;a href=&#34;https://babeljs.io/&#34;&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;gdd0r g&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/neovim/neovim&#34;&gt;neov&lt;/a&gt;1fuh&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;ith&lt;/a&gt;u&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lepture/mistune&#34;&gt;ist&lt;/a&gt;fh&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.archlinux.org/&#34;&gt;rc&lt;/a&gt;8gzvf&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/&#34;&gt;tow&lt;/a&gt;fi&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki&#34;&gt;med&lt;/a&gt;uwh&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Tabber&#34;&gt;tab&lt;/a&gt;f2&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/dotfiles&#34;&gt;do&lt;/a&gt;fq&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tmux/tmux&#34;&gt;tmu&lt;/a&gt;d&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.neomutt.org/&#34;&gt;mu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and let me tell you, MediaWiki is something… special alright but it&amp;rsquo;s solid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be silly of course to think that somehow knowing a bunch of frameworks and languages will somehow mean I&amp;rsquo;m set for life because that&amp;rsquo;s nonsense talk. It&amp;rsquo;s all about knowing picking the right tool for the right job, y&amp;rsquo;know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do more this year is reading more about actual software stories. I started reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreaming_in_Code&#34;&gt;Dreaming in Code&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year which seems to be a &amp;ldquo;what not to do&amp;rdquo; manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, Scott Rosenberg often veers so far into tangents that half the book feels more like a history lesson than development but that&amp;rsquo;s good! Software won&amp;rsquo;t save you, or the planet, on its own. You gotta focus on the people behind it and getting them working together as a proper team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post isn&amp;rsquo;t actually about anything as you can tell. It&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld&#34;&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt; of posts. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s not true since Seinfeld isn&amp;rsquo;t actually about nothing, it&amp;rsquo;s just a show without drama. It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to just be regular life because your average person doesn&amp;rsquo;t live out &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City&#34;&gt;Sex in the City&lt;/a&gt; on a daily basis. I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually seen that show though, it&amp;rsquo;s just used as a punchline a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure if I look back at today, I&amp;rsquo;ll wonder what I was even worried about. If you think about friends or coworkers, do you even really remember meeting them? It&amp;rsquo;s like as soon as you properly know someone, you just kinda forget any awkward moments before your first interaction. I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s like that with jobs. You just kinda turn up one day and, assuming you try your best, you just kinda slot in nicely as if you&amp;rsquo;d been there the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I better deploy this thing before my taxi gets here. It&amp;rsquo;s still kinda crazy to me that I can just give away the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcus-crane/site/blob/95ae742bbf33662f4dd4cf284e463d0f9320c8d1/site/posts/blog/2018/2018-02-12-day-xero.md&#34;&gt;actual post file&lt;/a&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re reading with a few entries into a terminal. Yes, I had to manually make that link because this post even in the repo yet! That&amp;rsquo;s like some kinda preemptive sharing, whoaaa mannnnn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who learnt piece by piece, pouring a bunch of hours into Right Click -&amp;gt; View Page Source, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to give my own stuff back. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember who said it or when but someone once said something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t write code, I merely borrow it.&amp;rdquo; Their point wasn&amp;rsquo;t that they spend all day on Stack Overflow but rather that none of their ideas are truly original. Nothing is original because it&amp;rsquo;s all inspired by things that came before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, ok, my time is actually almost up and while I&amp;rsquo;m a bit freaked out that I&amp;rsquo;ll be diving into my first full time software job after years of being a hobbyist, there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that I try to remind myself. I might not truly know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing but neither does anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone else once told me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults are just kids who got older&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Installing Arch Linux on my Intel NUC</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/arch-nuc-install/</link>
      <description>My self help guide to installing Arch</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/arch-nuc-install/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;div class=&#34;notice&#34;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
  ⚰️ Is this up to date?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I used to fiddle with Arch, and other Linux distros when I was younger, I don&amp;rsquo;t run it as my daily driver nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to reinstall Arch Linux tomorrow, I would still dogfood my own guide and expect that it should be fairly seemless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t expect much has changed, you should know that I&amp;rsquo;m not actively verifying that these steps haven&amp;rsquo;t changed or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s that time again where I decide to reinstall Arch Linux and likely end up bashing my head against a wall. I have an old blog post on my Github but it could be better so this is an extended version mainly for my own future reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that this isn&amp;rsquo;t some guide for pros or that I expect to have the most 100% correct or efficient method of installing. It&amp;rsquo;s just what I know works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-online&#34;&gt;Getting online&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m installing on an Intel NUC, I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume you might like it run it mainly via WiFi so we&amp;rsquo;ll start by getting online. You can do this graphically by running &lt;code&gt;wifi-menu&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;wifi-menu
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve set up a profile, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a new entry when using the &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; command and you can confirm you&amp;rsquo;re online with &lt;code&gt;ping archlinux.org -c 3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-your-hard-drive&#34;&gt;Setting up your hard drive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t, and probably couldn&amp;rsquo;t (yet) install Arch Linux as a dual boot partition. That is, alongside another operating system such as Windows or macOS. You might like to and that&amp;rsquo;s great but this isn&amp;rsquo;t the guide for you :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to see what our current devices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;fdisk -l
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may see a few. In my case, my hard drive has a few &lt;code&gt;/dev/sda&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; entries and my USB has 2 &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; entries. For the purposes of this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll be assuming that your hard drive is under &lt;code&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/code&gt; but when installing to, say, a Macbook, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the hard drive can be under &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hard drive will end up looking as follows once I&amp;rsquo;ve set it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;SIZE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;LOCATION&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;500M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Boot Sector&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/boot&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20G&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;System Root&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8G&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Swap Space&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;437G&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Home Directory&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/home&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m targeting a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface&#34;&gt;UEFI&lt;/a&gt; BIOS so we&amp;rsquo;ll be using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table&#34;&gt;GPT&lt;/a&gt; for our partition table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html&#34;&gt;gparted&lt;/a&gt; which you may or may not be familiar with if you&amp;rsquo;ve only use GUI installers before. Just follow along and I&amp;rsquo;ll comment what each segment is roughly doing. From hereon in, URLs prefixed by a tilde (~) indicate resources where you can read further information if you&amp;rsquo;re the curious sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice&#34;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;⚠️&lt;/span&gt;Consider yourself warned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following &lt;em&gt;WILL&lt;/em&gt; wipe your hard drive so ensure that this is what you&amp;rsquo;d like to do and/or that you&amp;rsquo;ve backed up everything from any currently installed OS&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;partitioning&#34;&gt;Partitioning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Launched parted, passing our hard drive as an argument&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;parted /dev/sda
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Create a partition table using the GUID Partition Table (GPT) format.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# This wipes your drive(!)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mklabel gpt
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;DEVICE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;FORMAT&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;ext4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;ext4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/home&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-file-systems&#34;&gt;Making file systems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t need any utilites to create our file systems, we can just do &amp;rsquo;em straight outta the box like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Create a 32bit VFAT filesystem for our boot partition&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# VFAT is essentially FAT32 with support for longer filenames. See below for more details.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# ~ https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/263731&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Create an ext4 filesystem for our root partition&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Prepare a swap area&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mkswap /dev/sda3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Activate our created swap area&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;swapon /dev/sda3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Create an ext4 filesystem for our home partition&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that our hard drive is completely set up, we&amp;rsquo;re ready to mount our file systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mounting-our-new-file-systems&#34;&gt;Mounting our new file systems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as a reminder, here&amp;rsquo;s where we want our partitions to end up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;DEVICE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;FORMAT&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;LOCATION&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/dev/sda1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ESP&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/boot&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/dev/sda2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ext4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/dev/sda4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ext4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/home&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how this layout translates into mount commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Mount our root partition to /mnt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# NOTE: /mnt doesn&amp;#39;t persist once we&amp;#39;re in our bash prompt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# For example, /mnt/home becomes just /home&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Create a folder which our ESP partition will be mounted to&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mkdir /mnt/boot
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Mount our ESP partition to /boot&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Create a home folder where all of our user directories will live&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mkdir /mnt/home
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Mount the home partition to /home&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/home
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice! We&amp;rsquo;re completely done and can start to actually install and configure Arch Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-base-packages&#34;&gt;Installing base packages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we need to download and install the base packages for Arch Linux to our &lt;code&gt;/mnt&lt;/code&gt; which will becomes our root (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;) later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pacstrap /mnt base
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the curious, the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; group contains a number of default libraries and utilties you may have used such as &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view the &lt;code&gt;pacstrap&lt;/code&gt; script itself &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.archlinux.org/arch-install-scripts.git/tree/pacstrap.in&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it would be quite longer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script also runs the &lt;code&gt;mkinitcpio&lt;/code&gt; bash script which you can learn more about &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mkinitcpio#Overview&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire process may take a few minutes so feel free to read ahead while you wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-up-bash&#34;&gt;Set up bash&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Arch Linux installed, we can finally move off of our live USB and start a bash process to set up our freshly initialised system after 2 more quick steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1 is generating a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linfo.org/etc_fstab.html&#34;&gt;file systems table&lt;/a&gt;, referred to as &lt;code&gt;fstab&lt;/code&gt; going forward. This is done so that all devices (/dev/sdaX) specificied in the file are mounted automatically on startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;genfstab -U /mnt &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /mnt/etc/fstab
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-U&lt;/code&gt; flag denotes that we want to identify our devices using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier&#34;&gt;UUIDs&lt;/a&gt;, instead of labels, as noted &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/falconindy/arch-install-scripts/blob/master/genfstab.in#L86&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2 is even quicker!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;arch-chroot /mnt
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;arch-chroot&lt;/code&gt;, seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/falconindy/arch-install-scripts/blob/master/arch-chroot.in&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; changes the root directory to, well, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; which is our new root directory. As we&amp;rsquo;re still on the live USB, we specify it as &lt;code&gt;/mnt&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;arch-chroot&lt;/code&gt; is also able to take some flags following the root partition such as &lt;code&gt;arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that the preceeding example is actually fairly pointless seeing as &lt;code&gt;arch-chroot&lt;/code&gt; already defaults to &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huzzah! We&amp;rsquo;re finally in our new system but will it boot? Not quite yet and we&amp;rsquo;ve still a lot to set up so let&amp;rsquo;s carry on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;updates-and-other-dependencies-optional&#34;&gt;Updates and other dependencies (optional)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, I like to run a system upgrade using &lt;code&gt;pacman -Syu&lt;/code&gt; just in case. As we&amp;rsquo;ve just pulled our dependencies minutes ago, it&amp;rsquo;ll likely find nothing but I reckon it feels good, haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also need some extra bits and pieces for later at this point. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t have fetched these earlier as trying to run &lt;code&gt;pacman&lt;/code&gt;, the Arch Linux package manager, from the live USB would attempt to install to the USB itself and error out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need the following bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;PACKAGE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://invisible-island.net/dialog/&#34;&gt;dialog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A library for console-based UIs like &lt;code&gt;wifi-menu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://downloadcenter.intel.com/search?keyword=microcode+data&#34;&gt;intel-ucode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Micro-code updates for Intel CPUs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://w1.fi/wpa_supplicant/&#34;&gt;wpa_supplicant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Used to connect to wireless networks (put simply)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be everything for now. The other bits (&lt;code&gt;netctl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dhcpcd&lt;/code&gt;) were already installed as part of the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; group from earlier. If you&amp;rsquo;re using Ethernet, you can basically skip this entire step hence why it&amp;rsquo;s marked as optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, we don&amp;rsquo;t really need &lt;code&gt;dialog&lt;/code&gt; as we could just use &lt;code&gt;netctl&lt;/code&gt; directly but I find it more user friendly and I&amp;rsquo;m not a masochist, haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might as well also enable &lt;code&gt;dhcpcd&lt;/code&gt; if you need it for ethernet with &lt;code&gt;systemctl enable dhcpcd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;generating-locale&#34;&gt;Generating locale&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popular software often ships in a number of languages but in order to show the correct language, currency and so on, it needs to know where you live. We achieve this by generating and setting a locale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/locale.gen&lt;/code&gt; and uncomment your respective locale. In short, the format is &lt;code&gt;{language}_{country code}.{character encoding}&lt;/code&gt;. As an example, I&amp;rsquo;m in New Zealand so I uncomment the line &lt;code&gt;en_NZ.UTF-8 UTF-8&lt;/code&gt;. If in doubt, just opt for &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just use &lt;code&gt;nano&lt;/code&gt; but if you prefer, this would be an alright time to run &lt;code&gt;pacman -S vim&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve done that, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to generate the locale files and export your language to your environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;locale-gen
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;LANG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;={&lt;/span&gt;xx&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;_&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;yy&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;.UTF-8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If done successfully, &lt;code&gt;echo $LANG&lt;/code&gt; will display your locale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, the actual &lt;code&gt;locale-gen&lt;/code&gt; script can be seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=localedata/gen-locale.sh;h=39f1475cbc45faaae32728dbfd7cce282c3cdb05;hb=HEAD&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=summary&#34;&gt;glibc&lt;/a&gt;, the GNU implementation of the C standard library. I always wondered where it was from!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;timezone&#34;&gt;Timezone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting our timezone is fairly straightforward thanks to an interactive program called &lt;code&gt;tzselect&lt;/code&gt;. Running it will show a list of continents and oceans. Selecting one will drill down to display countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve confirmed the output, it will mention appending the timezone to a file. Instead, we want to symlink that timezone to a file. In my case, the timezone is &lt;code&gt;Pacific/Auckland&lt;/code&gt; but of course, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to input your respective timezone instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Pacific/Auckland /etc/localtime
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-hardware-clock&#34;&gt;Setting hardware clock&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last of our locale related setups is configuring the system clock. To do that, we&amp;rsquo;ll tell our hardware clock to set the system time using the &lt;code&gt;--hctosys&lt;/code&gt; option. You can read more about &lt;code&gt;hwclock&lt;/code&gt; and how it differs from system time &lt;a href=&#34;https://linux.die.net/man/8/hwclock&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;hwclock --systohc
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hostname-setup&#34;&gt;Hostname setup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We like life to be simple (but no simpler) and giving our computer/server a unique name is an important part of that process. For this bit, let&amp;rsquo;s assume we want to name our system &lt;code&gt;weinerdog&lt;/code&gt; because it sounds silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; weinerdog &amp;gt; /etc/hostname
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, that was easy. We also need to tell our system that &lt;code&gt;weinerdog&lt;/code&gt; is an alias for &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;, just like &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; is. We could fire up our favourite editor but it&amp;rsquo;s likely &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; is empty so just do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; 127.0.0.1 localhost weinerdog &amp;gt; /etc/hosts
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How quick was that, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-a-root-password&#34;&gt;Set a root password&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be using this password to login, which I sometimes forget. It should be different than the password for the user account we&amp;rsquo;ll be making soon but I&amp;rsquo;d be lying if I said I have a super secure password. You have bigger problems if you think this writeup will give you top notch security anyway. I&amp;rsquo;m just here for a usable system!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;passwd
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just type in your password twice. Not much more to it than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-a-boot-manager&#34;&gt;Installing a boot manager&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be using &lt;code&gt;systemd-boot&lt;/code&gt; as our EFI boot manager. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you anything about it other than it works and that&amp;rsquo;s good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bootctl --path&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/boot install
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above command copies the &lt;code&gt;systemd-boot&lt;/code&gt; binary to our EFI System Partition (&lt;code&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt;) and adds it as the default EFI application to be loaded as stated &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-boot#EFI_boot&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuring-the-boot-manager&#34;&gt;Configuring the boot manager&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a boot manager, we need to tell it what to boot exactly. We&amp;rsquo;ll create a new &lt;code&gt;arch.conf&lt;/code&gt; entry using &lt;code&gt;nano&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;nano /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and enter the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;title Arch Linux
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;linux /vmlinuz-linux
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;initrd /intel-ucode.img
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;initrd /initramfs-linux.img
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;options &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/dev/sda2 rw &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;elevator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;deadline quiet splash &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;resume&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/dev/sda3 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;nmi_watchdog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: The line &lt;code&gt;initrd /intel-ucode.img&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; applies if you installed the &lt;code&gt;intel-ucode&lt;/code&gt; package from earlier which anyone with an Intel CPU should do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the options, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say if you need, or don&amp;rsquo;t need, any of them but it&amp;rsquo;s worked fine for me so far. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably read up on them in depth shortly and update this post as required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that&amp;rsquo;s created, set it as the default configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;default arch&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; /boot/loader/loader.conf
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and now you&amp;rsquo;re ready to reboot into a nicely working system!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;reboot
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve still got a lot to learn about Arch Linux but so far, the above setup has worked well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s still more that goes into a system but this is enough to get past the pesky initial setup which gave me hours upon hours of grief as a beginner, which I still am essentially.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some thoughts about running a wiki</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/wiki-thoughts/</link>
      <description>I ran a Wiki for a little while and here&#39;s what I learned</description>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/wiki-thoughts/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started playing a mobile game called &lt;a href=&#34;http://bs.visualshower.com/&#34;&gt;Blustone&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect and for all the minor issues I have with it, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty enjoyable for the most part. The most important draw however has been the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not huge and it does have its bad apples but for the most part, I&amp;rsquo;ve met a few nice people online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that brings me to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vsfan.net/wiki&#34;&gt;VSFan&lt;/a&gt; which I started since there were hardly any English resources, let alone gathered all in one place. I always thought sites like &lt;a href=&#34;http://serebii.net/&#34;&gt;Serebii&lt;/a&gt; were cool as a kid and wished I could make my own site like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I should probably mention that VSFan is short for &lt;a href=&#34;http://visualshower.com/&#34;&gt;VisualShower Fan&lt;/a&gt;, in reference to the developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was half an excuse to dig into a project I cared about and half to generate some decent community resources because generally that stuff is already taken care of for most games by people much more dedicated than myself so this was quite a discover finding something that&amp;rsquo;s hardly documented beyond a handful of YouTube videos and some scattered blog posts and walkthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;ll probably be my first project that actually has some proper viewership and it kinda gives me the shits a bit knowing that the longer it exists, the more it&amp;rsquo;s engrained into Google&amp;rsquo;s search results or old chat messages/forum posts so there&amp;rsquo;s no going back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve got nightly backups, both stored on the server itself (I can only afford one for now!) plus rsynced out to my little Intel NUC server at home so I am actually treating this properly but I think freaking out a little goes for anything that gets put online. I&amp;rsquo;ve been solving that by not running any analytics or looking at the server logs and just pretending it&amp;rsquo;s only me and a few pals editing. There might not even be any users for all I know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Err, I feel like I had a point since I&amp;rsquo;m writing this as I go. Oh yeah, the next thing I&amp;rsquo;ll be having to think about all the community management bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registrations require email verification, primarily due to one rogue spambot a few weeks back but I think it also works nicely as a buffer for quality. While some users may feel going into their email client and back is too much work, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a low enough barrier that it&amp;rsquo;ll deter those who aren&amp;rsquo;t invested enough to register an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is guidelines which I still need to write. You don&amp;rsquo;t wanna make them too strict but you also don&amp;rsquo;t want to say &amp;ldquo;Go nuts, do anything&amp;rdquo; because you&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably end up with vandalism. Personally, my primary concern is a drop in quality but I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s flawed both in the sense that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to be objective about your own tastes/skills and also it assumes a lot about others who may/will be just as hard working. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any trouble admitting that however because if you can&amp;rsquo;t, then how can you possibly get rid of those concerns, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m the &amp;ldquo;creator&amp;rdquo;, I definitely think the best route is to treat admin roles as janitors essentially. Sure, they clean up messes and we likely don&amp;rsquo;t give janitors enough credit but as soon as you attach a social standing or a general elevation of &amp;ldquo;worth&amp;rdquo; to your roles, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a meltdown waiting to happen. It&amp;rsquo;ll only ever serve to separate groups and, probably, generate nepotism and what not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flipside though, treating everyone equally is silly because some users will be better at some things than others. Some users may be immature (which isn&amp;rsquo;t always tied to age) and may propose nonsense rules or err, be unable to &amp;ldquo;see the trees for the forest&amp;rdquo; as they say. I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any specific examples at the moment but I guess what I&amp;rsquo;m getting at is that you do need moderation but as long as you only use it in, ahem, moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another spark of division I wonder about is the following scenario. Let&amp;rsquo;s say I&amp;rsquo;m interested in contributing but I&amp;rsquo;m too literal when it comes to condensing the contents of an episode into a summary. I might write &amp;ldquo;X did this. Next, X did that. Y came along.&amp;rdquo; which is technically correct and accurate but it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily enjoyable to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may say &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t post if it&amp;rsquo;s not quality&amp;rdquo; because they&amp;rsquo;re interested in keeping the bar high at all times. Seeing as we&amp;rsquo;re just getting started, our focus should be on content. Not only that but having something is often better than nothing at all. Provided it&amp;rsquo;s detailed enough, it gives a starting point which the &amp;ldquo;wordsmiths&amp;rdquo; among us can shape without having to invest time into research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, it gives users with different abilities and experience levels things to do. If you&amp;rsquo;re not so great at writing, make some stubs or provide some referencial data like EXP tables or pull some better screenshots. While the main resource for a wiki is text, fortunately there are more ways than one to communicate with the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Err, anyway, this whole post was pretty impromptu and I just wanted to spit out some stuff I&amp;rsquo;d been thinking about for a while now. None of it is edited and chances are I&amp;rsquo;ll never read it again but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I made any typos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any thoughts yourself or just want to leave a comment, you can send me a tweet to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sentreh&#34;&gt;@sentreh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>An exploration of Deepfakes written up when the original subreddit (and creator) was still online</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      <author><name>Marcus Crane</name></author>
      <guid>https://utf9k.net/blog/deepfakes/</guid>
      <content type="html">&lt;div class=&#34;notice&#34;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
  💿 This post has been remastered slightly due to its age.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made some slight rewordings, fixed typos and revived any links I could using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/&#34;&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt; but otherwise, the post is 99% intact from when I first wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise just how much I had written about this at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m kind of glad since this was written before the subreddit was banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the content discussed is now lost to time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-overview&#34;&gt;An overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just under 2 weeks ago, an article from The Verge titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16929148/fake-celebrity-porn-ai-deepfake-face-swapping-artificial-intelligence-reddit&#34;&gt;Fake celebrity porn is blowing up on Reddit, thanks to artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; was posted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16226495&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;d just glimpsed the headline, you might assume it&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of shitstirrers up to no good with Photoshop but unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s arguably worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, machine learning had been mainly kept within the realm of computer science due to its inherent complexity. As time marches on, new tools and libraries have popped up that make machine learning easier than ever to dive into for professionals and hobbyists alike. It was only a matter of time before someone decided to apply it to subjects considered taboo, and now we can see the results with a new crop of &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; pornography. Now, I say &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; to point out that this pornography isn&amp;rsquo;t real but with results often being indistinguishable from reality itself, it kinda renders the term &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; well… pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like the downsides were glaringly obvious at first but after discussing this topic with a few non-technical coworkers, they seemed to have missed the forest for the trees. Their responses typically focused on the &amp;ldquo;cool tech&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sweet custom porn&amp;rdquo; rather than realising that perhaps this is &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; Pandora&amp;rsquo;s box which we can&amp;rsquo;t go back from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my feelings on the matter, which can be summed up as &amp;ldquo;Oh fuck&amp;rdquo;, this is my attempt at rounding up both my own thoughts and those posted in the various discussion threads that followed. Before we begin, I should explain a bit more about this technology and how it works. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a master class on machine learning by any means. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be &lt;a href=&#34;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;as simple as possible, but not simpler&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because my understanding of the concepts involved is surface level at best. For anything deeper, you should seek out other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-deepfakes&#34;&gt;What are deepfakes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/user/deepfakes&#34;&gt;deepfakes&lt;/a&gt; is the name of a user on reddit who &amp;ldquo;pioneered&amp;rdquo; this new wave of computer-generated celebrity pornography. To further promote discussion, and share generated works, he created a subreddit named after himself – &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/deepfakes&#34;&gt;/r/deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;. The term &lt;strong&gt;deepfake&lt;/strong&gt; has since been coined to refer to the creations that followed and it&amp;rsquo;s the term I&amp;rsquo;ll be using going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-machine-learning&#34;&gt;What is machine learning?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the term &amp;ldquo;machine learning&amp;rdquo; might invoke visions of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)&#34;&gt;Skynet&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that said machines aren&amp;rsquo;t truly conscious like us humans. You&amp;rsquo;d think the ability to be self-aware and/or concious would be essential to learning, right? At its simplest, learning requires little more than a series of inputs (sound, sight, touch) which we then process in order to produce an output. When you first meet someone, you may forget their face but over time, you learn to recognise them as memories form. As time progresses, you can also identify them in different contexts such as an office, an airport or at a beach. In a rough sense, you&amp;rsquo;ve trained your brain to subconsciously identify their facial features so that it can recall which memories they&amp;rsquo;ve appeared in before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another crucial part of learning is the ability to weigh up how confident we are in our judgements. If we aren&amp;rsquo;t confident enough in a decision, we&amp;rsquo;ll opt either to do nothing or pursue an alternative choice. For instance, each time you meet a friend, your brain is thinking &amp;ldquo;Ah, I&amp;rsquo;m 99% sure that&amp;rsquo;s my friend Sarah&amp;rdquo;. On the flipside, I&amp;rsquo;m short sighted but silly enough to not wear my glasses. Because of that, I might recognise the general facial features of someone across the street but without moving closer, I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough visual information to be sure. My own brain is thinking &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m only 40% confident that&amp;rsquo;s Pat&amp;rdquo; and decides to not call it a definite match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit hand wavy but in essence, those are the two important elements. A machine &amp;ldquo;learns&amp;rdquo; by being fed data continuously and having its output judged. A facial detection network may be trained on photos of a single person, just like in our memory analogy, and then asked to identify if they are present in a handful of photos. It would respond Yes or No along with its level of confidence which can be checked against the actual answer. Those results are then fed back into the machine and it continues to improve itself as time goes on. The next training step of such an example might be continuously seeing if wanted criminals appear in live CCTV footage of an airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-how-do-deepfakes-work&#34;&gt;So how do deepfakes work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does this all relate to deepfakes? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a type of neural network. A what now, you say? It&amp;rsquo;s essentially what I just described, which is a network that takes an output, does some unknown (hidden) calculations in the middle and returns an output. There are many different networks, with different numbers of inputs and outputs but in the case of deepfakes, we&amp;rsquo;re only dealing with one of each. There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20180206231055/https://www.reddit.com/r/deepfakes/comments/7pgcg4/detailed_explanation_of_the_algorithm/&#34;&gt;breakdown&lt;/a&gt; of how it functions but I felt it wasn&amp;rsquo;t detailed enough for the casual observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to our facial detection example from just before, deepfakes uses two &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder&#34;&gt;autoencoder&lt;/a&gt; networks. One is trained on numerous photos of a celebrity while the other is trained on numerous photos of a &amp;ldquo;porn star&amp;rdquo; or performer which is the term I&amp;rsquo;ll be using. The photos first are cropped so that only faces are displayed. Those faces are then fed into the networks as inputs. Photos of the celebrity go into Network A and photos of the performer go into Network B. You may like to read through &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/autoencoders-deep-learning-bits-1-11731e200694&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article too, in order to get a better idea of autoencoders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggled to understand the next step for quite some time as any mention of it was quite vague, however &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02932v2.pdf&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; paper, mentioned by deepfakes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/deepfakes/comments/7jqvny/release_face_swap_model_tool/dreu4rl/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as his inspiration seems to shed some light. The rough version seems to be that the input faces are encoded into a compressed representation. The image below helps to illustrate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;celebs.png&#34; alt=&#34;An diagram depicting how faces can be mapped to one another. The diagram shows photos of 6 celebrities and then shows how they look when transformed into a spherical shape. Various facial features such as eyes and nose roughly share the same positions, unlike in the regular photos used in the comparison.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t an accurate depiction of how deepfakes goes about its encoding, but serves as a useful mental model to understand how a representation may look. Notice how despite the celebrities above being different shapes and sizes, they can all be deconstructed into a spherical texture with eyes, nose and mouth roughly in the same positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;cats.png&#34; alt=&#34;Similar to the previous image, this diagram shows the process of transforming six photos of various cats into more spherical representations.&#34;  /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, here is another example with cats. Despite the large variation in not only fur colour, but even the directions they&amp;rsquo;re facing, they all map fairly equally into a spherical structure. For a computer, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a useful visualisation so instead these representations will all just be stored as data points. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/deepfakes/comments/7pgcg4/detailed_explanation_of_the_algorithm/dshkv3o/&#34;&gt;One explanation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; suggests that eg; a right eyebrow might be interpreted as &amp;ldquo;a line from X to Y&amp;rdquo; for one celebrity while another may see the right eyebrow as &amp;ldquo;a curve […] along points W, X, Y and Z&amp;rdquo;. One of the biggest annoyances with networks is that it can be quite confusing to understand how they&amp;rsquo;re working and sometimes even &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/deepfakes/comments/7jqvny/release_face_swap_model_tool/dra7ayi/&#34;&gt;their own creators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have no idea why decisions are being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens with this representation? It actually just recreates the original image to the best of its ability. It won&amp;rsquo;t always be accurate to start with but over the course of many hours training its internal model, both networks begin to reliably decode the representations back into their respective faces. As more training iterations are performs, the network is exposed to different lighting conditions, facial expressions and so on. An error function measures the resulting image against the original so that it can continue to try different decoding variation, in the pursuit of accuracy. Do note too that the networks share the same facial encoder while each has a uniquely trained facial decoder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the user has determined that both models are sufficiently trained, the network is fed a video. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that videos are little more than a series of images. Each frame is cropped to just the face and fed into the network of the performer. As the encoders are shared, it&amp;rsquo;s able to build an intermediate representation of any general face. The trick this time is that the decoders are switched midway. Since the celebrity decoder is uniquely trained, it can&amp;rsquo;t help but reconstruct the representation into the face of the celebrity while still inheriting the details (expression, facial structure) of the performer. The result is that the performers face is morphed to look exactly like that of the celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without much in the way of deeply detailed explanations to go on, this is my best attempt however I can&amp;rsquo;t speak much on the final conversation process. To illustrate the result, here is the original &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal_Gadot&#34;&gt;Gal Gadot&lt;/a&gt; conversion posted by deepfakes himself. &lt;strong&gt;As indicated earlier, the following is pornography and is definitely not safe for work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice&#34;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
  There&amp;#39;s nothing here anymore!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This portion originally linked to an extremely &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work&#34;&gt;NSFW&lt;/a&gt; deepfake video for archival purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to reside at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pornhub.com/embed/ph5a27755783e28&#34;&gt;https://www.pornhub.com/embed/ph5a27755783e28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref3:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but has long since been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original caption I provided read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The video was a pornstar with Gal Gadot&amp;rsquo;s face. Not really her face but overlaid on the body of someone else. The scary thing is you couldn&amp;rsquo;t easily distinguish that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t fake!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&#34;hidden&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose the clip above because it provides a good indication of what works but also what can go wrong. There&amp;rsquo;s a number of instances where the result is miserable, such as 1:09 where multiple facial expressions flash one after the other. Often times, the edges of the overlaid face can clearly be seen, giving an idea of which elements have been replaced. All in all though, the result can be frighteningly accurate, just with the small amount of code that the creator referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/deepfakes/comments/7jqvny/release_face_swap_model_tool/dr8hk8e/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;embarassingly simple&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref4:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-this-bad&#34;&gt;Is this bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s really up to your own personal beliefs, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? It would seem to be a moral issue at best, as technically it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be illegal. An interviewee in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/face-swap-porn-legal-limbo/&#34;&gt;this Wired story&lt;/a&gt; sums it up as far as US law is concerned: &amp;ldquo;There are all sorts of First Amendment problems because it’s not their real body.&amp;rdquo;. The assumption seems to be that any such creations could be considered art, not unlike a painting or a photoshop edit, which is legally understandable, but still feels a bit ethically shady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious societal issue here is that it&amp;rsquo;s presumably the next step in being able to objectify others? Rejected by your crush? Bust out the ol&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.com&#34;&gt;Human Pokedex&lt;/a&gt; and scrape enough data to generate your own virtual fantasy. They might object but that&amp;rsquo;s ok, right? You&amp;rsquo;re not actually there to respect their wishes, it&amp;rsquo;s their body you&amp;rsquo;re after and that&amp;rsquo;s all, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there&amp;rsquo;s no point preaching to the choir on this. Those who get off on this stuff can easily justify it to themselves because &amp;ldquo;lol it&amp;rsquo;s not actually them, its fake!!&amp;rdquo;. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if there&amp;rsquo;s a teenager in awe right now who becomes the real life &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Callister&#34;&gt;Robert Daly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s easy to think one man has started this all, he does &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/deepfakes/comments/7jqvny/release_face_swap_model_tool/drbv6io/&#34;&gt;have a point&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref5:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in that this really was inevitable. There are other projects that are more concerning, not for where they could lead, but for what they can do right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post has already gone on long enough so here&amp;rsquo;s a few proof of concepts off the top of my head that give an indication of where we&amp;rsquo;re headed&lt;/p&gt;
