# Fullscreen Images
01 January 0001

At present, I render images such that clicking on them takes you directly to the image but it&#39;d be nice to be able to tap to view the image in fullscreen without the overhead of navigating away.

&lt;img style=&#34;width: 150px; margin: 0 auto;&#34; alt=&#34;A photo of a Muzi plush, from Kakao Friends, sitting on my sofa&#34; src=&#34;./linefriend.jpg&#34;&gt;
