    <p>This one probably needs a bit of explanation, more than most of my projects.</p>
<p>The short version is that here in New Zealand, we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Information_Act_1982">Official Information Act of 1982</a> or OIA for short.</p>
<p>It allows anyone in New Zealand, permanent or otherwise, to request almost any sort of information from members of government.</p>
<p>I once wrote a getting started guide that go through the background and all that <a href="/blog/nz-oia-guide">here</a> so I can recommend that for extra context.</p>
<p>Anyway, in saying this, there are certain &ldquo;grounds&rdquo; that can be invoked to redact or retain secrets such as those that might affect the privacy of a person or cause economic troubles for example.</p>
<p>That got me thinking. While the contents of redacted OIAs may not be accessible to the public, metadata about those OIAs can be just as interesting and so that&rsquo;s what this project is about.</p>
<p>Each year, I make a request to the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office and ask for a list of OIAs that have been redacted or denied each year.</p>
<p>Admittedly, a few years I&rsquo;ve forgotten to explicitly request the particular date so half of my data set are just time ranges but generally, the titles and grounds for denial are the most interesting.</p>
<p>At some point, I may file a request to backfill some data prior to when this list started but I haven&rsquo;t had any plans to do much more than keep it updated yearly as of yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m due to file my next update sometime around August or September 2021</p>
