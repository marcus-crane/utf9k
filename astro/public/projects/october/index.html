The window shows that a Kobo Libra H20 is currently connected. On the right is a single button that asks if the user would like to sync 249 highlights to Readwise. At the bottom is a toast saying that 217 highlights were sent to Readwise successfully."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>I&rsquo;m a user of <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a> which is a service that allows you to import all sorts of highlights from books and <a href="https://readwise.io/read">articles</a> through to tweets and even <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/comments-to-readwise/mbpckcijlikkkakedodgpgkdmgbdogmp">comments</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There is unofficial official support for Kindle and iBooks, by which I mean Readwise supports those sources but they are still not officially sanctioned (or known!) by Amazon and Apple respectively.</p>
<p>Kobo, which is the primary competitor to Kindle, has lots of nice eReaders but historically Readwise has had no support for them as they don&rsquo;t have a web UI to scrape.</p>
<p>The other part of the problem is that getting your highlights off of your device is very fiddly for technical users, and nigh-on-impossible for non-technical users as it requires performing SQL queries against a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.</p>
<p>This is where October comes in. It was created primarily to scratch my own itch. While I&rsquo;m perfectly capable of extracting highlights from my device, I also aspire to do as little work as possible.</p>
<p>This first version is very sparse and gives the user very little option besides syncing their highlights. It works well for myself, and has helped a few users but it doesn&rsquo;t provide much ability to introspect the upload process or control eg; which books are uploaded.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve begun work on a rewrite from the ground up which provides more control and insight to the end user.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, October is promoted within Readwise itself as the only option for uploading Kobo highlights. Previously, the Readwise team had released an integration for uploading store-bought highlights via Kobo APIs but this was unfortunately shut down.</p>
<p>On a technical level, October is comprised of a <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> frontend with the backend being powered by <a href="https://wails.io/">Wails</a>, a relatively new Golang framework for creating applications.</p>
<p>As the React frontend is bundled up into minimised HTML, this results in October weighing in at a measly 12 megabytes.</p>
<p>It features a Windows build, a fully code signed macOS version and a Linux version works experimentally<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> but is not currently distributed.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, most of the reading I have done over the duration of this project has been making random highlights as a pseudo-integration test.</p>
<p>If I look at things from a big picture view, I would probably read a lot more if I just deleted this project and resorted to manually uploading my highlights!</p>

<p>There are lots of comments that I want to make notes on but Readwise doesn&rsquo;t support importing these. It makes sense of course since every website layout is arbitrary but to scratch my own itch, I made a Chrome extension that sends Hacker News and Reddit comments to Readwise.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to compile it if this is useful to you! I haven&rsquo;t looked into distribution and packaging plus last I checked, Linux support for Wails was solid but technically still marked as experimental.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
