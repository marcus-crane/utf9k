# Thanks
01 January 0001

There’s no requirement on the internet to say thanks but I’d have absolutely no inspiration (or site) without the following.

In no particular order, shout outs to:

Commonmark for being a solid format that I don’t have to think about at all.

Cloudflare Design for making it easy to visualise contrasting colours, and seeing how accessible they are.

Fastmail for being one of the few providers that seemingly allows hassle-free, unlimited aliasing.

Feedbin for being a visually nice RSS reader but also for some design elements I “borrowed”. Namely the background color of the Sunset theme and the top favicon bar that appears when reading an article.

Fly.io for making it easy to deploy Gunslinger which powers some of the live aspects of this site. They’re also just generally a cool bunch of people who write really insightful blog posts.

Hugo is the static site generator I use so without that, there wouldn’t be any site! Well, that’s not true, I’d just be using a different one but Hugo seems to be the “best” at present.

MDN is the only thing saving me from homelessness. I’d be hosed without this internet bible.

owlspace inspired me to get back into my redesign again. It has a nice homey, handcrafted feeling to it and makes me want to improve my own site much more.
