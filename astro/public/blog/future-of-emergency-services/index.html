    <p>Yesterday, I had an onset of severe abdominal pains. I didn&rsquo;t want to overreact so I called <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/services-and-support/health-care-services/healthline">Healthline</a> who recommended I see either my GP, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department">A&amp;E</a> within the next 6 hours.</p>
<p>Shortly after I hung up, I had a pain spike bad enough to make me burst into tears. I wasn&rsquo;t getting anywhere clutching my stomach on the floor so I called an ambulance.</p>
<p>An operator took my information, said that someone would be on their way and then hung up. I waited… and waited… Just over an hour passed before I gave up and called an Uber. One just happened to be 2 minutes away, with the entire trip only taking about 10 minutes from start to finish.</p>
<p>Part of me worried they had turned up only to find me not there so I called back and asked to have the request cancelled. They did so and I asked what the state of the callout was only to find that nothing was ever dispatched due to a high callout rate in my area. Presumably based on my age and the symptoms, they figured I was at low risk?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t leave me with a good feeling or sense of security but it did get me wondering about two things: Statistics and the future of emergency services.</p>
<p>Most of this article would likely have been joking about how there will probably be &ldquo;Uber for Ambulances&rdquo; as I often have.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>new startup idea: uber for ambulances. cheaper rates than a normal ambulance unless rugby is on then it&rsquo;s 6x surge prices or you&rsquo;re fucked — <a href="https://twitter.com/sentreh">@sentreh</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/upshot/uber-lyft-and-the-urgency-of-saving-money-on-ambulances.html">a</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/taking-uber-lyft-emergency-room-legal-liabilities">few</a> writeups about how patients are using ridesharing services in place of ambulances and I think I understand why.</p>
<p><a href="http://www2.ku.edu/~kuwpaper/2017Papers/201708.pdf">This non-peer reviewed paper</a> in particular, from the University of Kansas, noted an 8% decline in ambulance callouts following the launch of Uber in each respective city measured in the study.</p>
<p>Now having said all this, there was actually an announcement this time last year for <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-health/">Uber Health</a> in the US. The service is more for booking health-related rides on behalf of patients, as opposed to straight up replacing ambulances but give it enough time and I could see that extra capacity being leveraged to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>My second question, and one that I&rsquo;m not really qualified to answer, is to do with the actual callout rates.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_New_Zealand">St John</a> Organisation are the primary dispatcher of ambulances in New Zealand, providing emergency services to <a href="https://www.stjohn.org.nz/What-we-do/St-John-Ambulance-Services/">nearly 90% of New Zealanders</a> according to their own website.</p>
<p>They have a handy <a href="https://www.stjohn.org.nz/News--Info/Our-Performance/Response-Times/">section on response times</a> which links to the <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/new-zealand-health-system/key-health-sector-organisations-and-people/naso-national-ambulance-sector-office/emergency-ambulance-services-eas/performance-quality-and-safety/emergency-ambulance-service-national-performance-reports">Ministry of Health&rsquo;s Emergency Ambulance Service national performance reports</a>. Look a bit closer and you&rsquo;ll see &ldquo;For information about St John’s performance visit the performance section of their web site.&rdquo; which just leads us back to where we started!</p>
<p>Thankfully, their annual reports contain some of the information we&rsquo;re after. Let&rsquo;s take the <a href="https://www.stjohn.org.nz/globalassets/documents/publications/annual-report/stj-annual-report_2018_lq.pdf">2018 Annual report</a> as an example.</p>
<p>If we jump all the way to Page 50, we can see a breakdown of numbers with 533,669 ambulance emergency calls made. Another line item mentions 480,411 patients treated or transported by ambulance officers. If we were to very roughly assume that 1 call correlated with 1 patient, that would leave 53,258 calls that are never responded to.</p>
<p>Obviously that&rsquo;s not the whole picture. One call could be for a car crash with multiple injuries while the already deceased may not be counted as &ldquo;Patients treated or transported&rdquo;. Similarly, it doesn&rsquo;t take into account prank calls, duplicate calls and no-show patients who can&rsquo;t cancel callouts.</p>
<p>Either way, I think it still does point out that there&rsquo;s likely a chunk of callouts that never get responded to as a result of unstaffing combined with ever increasing callout numbers. It&rsquo;s pretty dystopian having something like the &ldquo;Gig Economy&rdquo; acting as a replacement for essential services but I suppose I&rsquo;ll take what I can get.</p>
<p>Besides, I never liked the attention that came with flashing lights and sirens anyway.</p>
