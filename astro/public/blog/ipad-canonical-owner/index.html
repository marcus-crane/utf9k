    <p>A few years ago, I ordered a 4th generation Apple iPad Air and the store I purchased it from accidentally sent me a demo unit.</p>
<p>It was a fully working iPad but it came preloaded with a number of dummy items such as a five calendars, a handful of documents and acres of photos.</p>
<p>You can see these in any store but generally, you never get a chance to spend any length of time with them so making the most of this opportunity, I took a full backup of the device before resetting it.</p>
<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="storedisplay.jpg" alt="A photo of an iPad Pro set up for display inside of a Noel Leeming store. Visible on the iPad is the Photos app set to the time period spanning 17 - 25th July 2019"  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>A few days later, the store got in contact with me and requested that I return it back to them since it wasn&rsquo;t meant to be dispatched. They didn&rsquo;t have any other units on hand so I ended up getting a refund instead.</p>
<p>Anyway, I figured it might be of some interest to someone so I <a href="https://archive.org/details/i-pad-demo-backup">uploaded a copy of the demo materials to the Internet Archive</a> and never got around to doing anything more until now.</p>
<p>Something that I had wondered was if any of the content in the device was actually intertwined or if it was just a random helping of documents.</p>
<p>The short answer is that it is mostly just random items but each category of item tends to have been created from the point of view of a single person which is kind of neat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be doing a brief rundown of what I found and what I could infer from the demo content about each fictional person as best as I can.</p>
<p>Some of the data is meaningless outside of the demo unit such as Photos which were grouped such as two images that were under the &ldquo;Selfies&rdquo; category but I can&rsquo;t recreate that information with the photos themselves so this post can&rsquo;t be as extensive as it could have been but ah well, I mainly want to get this post off of my project backlog once and for all!</p>
<h2 id="calendars">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#calendars" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Calendars
</h2><p>We&rsquo;ll start with the juiciest of all the categories first since the rest are fairly light on detail. We can infer quite a bit from the calendar from the various locations attached to events.</p>
<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="calendar.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;rsquo;s computer. 11 events are visible across five different calendars."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>Loaded onto the demo unit were 5 calendars which are available as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">ICS</a> exports for browsing with any Calendar client.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the calendar events consist entirely of recurring events which makes sense for a demo unit which may sit around for a number of years.</p>
<p>The five calendars available are called <code>Kids</code>, <code>Personal</code>, <code>Recreation</code>, <code>Training</code> and <code>Work</code>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mention in advance that a number of locations are mentioned in the calendar entries which are mostly real places around California so I dig into those a little bit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll work through them in order:</p>
<h3 id="kids">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#kids" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Kids
</h3><center>
  <figure>
    <img src="kids.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;rsquo;s computer. The Kids calendar is selected."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>There are only 3 events on the kids calendar which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adam&rsquo;s Piano lesson from 3:30pm - 4:30pm every Tuesday</li>
<li>Ellie&rsquo;s Soccer Game from 6:00pm - 8:00pm every Wednesday</li>
<li>Adam&rsquo;s Soccer Game from 11:00am - 2:00pm on every 5th Saturday</li>
</ul>
<p>We can infer that this person has two kids: Adam and Ellie. Both play Soccer and Adam plays the piano.</p>
<p>The description for <code>Ellie's Soccer Game</code> mentioned <code>At Mount Tiburon High School - back field on the left.</code> in the description for the event but as far as I can tell, there isn&rsquo;t a Mount Tiburon High School.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiburon,_California">Tiburon</a> is a real town in California that has a Mount Tiburon Road but no high school.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tiburon is apparently home to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiburon,_California#Schools">St. Hilary School</a> which is an <a href="https://www.apple.com/nz/education/k12/apple-distinguished-schools/">Apple Distinguished School</a> but it&rsquo;s probably a coincidence.</p>
<h3 id="personal">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#personal" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Personal
</h3><center>
  <figure>
    <img src="personal.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;rsquo;s computer. The Personal calendar is selected."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>This calendar is home to a few generic events such as &ldquo;Pay Bills&rdquo; and &ldquo;Doctor&rsquo;s Appointment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are a number of lunch and coffee catchups and they tend to be at real places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lunch with Pablo at <a href="https://www.michaelmina.net/restaurants/">Michael Mina</a> every 2 weeks</li>
<li>Lunch with Becky at <a href="https://yanksing.com/">Yank Sing</a> every 7 weeks</li>
<li>Lunch with Mum at <a href="https://hoodline.com/2017/09/french-bistro-south-park-cafe-to-bid-adieu/">Bistro - South Park</a> every 4 weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some other catchups but none of them feature any locations</p>
<h3 id="recreation">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#recreation" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Recreation
</h3><center>
  <figure>
    <img src="recreation.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;rsquo;s computer. The Recreation calendar is selected."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>This calendar is what it says on the tin and features a number of locations as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lunch with Lucy at <a href="https://yanksing.com/">Yank Sing</a> every 3 weeks</li>
<li>Bowling at Biltmore Lanes every month.
<ul>
<li>I couldn&rsquo;t find any information on Biltmore Lanes if that&rsquo;s a real place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neighbourhood Council at Community Centre on the 4th month of every Sunday
<ul>
<li>The community centre in question is not named but perhaps you could triangulate one by cross-referencing the locations the calendar owner visits?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yoga at <a href="https://2ndstreetgym.com/">2nd Street Gym</a> every 3 weeks</li>
<li>Brunch with Mindy at <a href="https://www.zaziesf.com/">Zazie</a> on the 1st Sunday of every month</li>
<li>Tennis with Katy at the 4th Street Courts every 3 weeks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="training">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#training" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Training
</h3><center>
  <figure>
    <img src="training.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;rsquo;s computer. The Training calendar is selected."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>I expected this calendar to be full of gym sessions but instead it&rsquo;s a work calendar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure who the training is in reference to, or if this calendar is even accurately named since it seems like a bunch of business meetings more than anything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design Team Staff Meeting: &ldquo;To review designs for this week&rsquo;s exec meetng and discuss remaining designs needed.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Review Graphic Design</li>
<li>Review Presentation with Susan</li>
<li>Project Planning Meeting: &ldquo;To discuss project plan and review milestones and deliverables&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this appears to be training unless it&rsquo;s training for design team members perhaps?</p>
<p>From this, we can infer that this person is perhaps some sort of product manager?</p>
<h3 id="work">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#work" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Work
</h3><center>
  <figure>
    <img src="work.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Calendar app visible on the author&amp;rsquo;s computer. The Work calendar is selected."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>This is definitely the fullest calendar with a number of business meetings and catchups.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly Team Meeting: &ldquo;To discuss project status and deliverables. Please bring status on each deliverable due this week.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Conference Call with Exec Team</li>
<li>Budget Review: &ldquo;To review budget plans for upcoming projects&rdquo;</li>
<li>Design Review</li>
<li>Team meeting</li>
<li>Contract Review with Allison</li>
<li>Executive Briefing</li>
<li>Expense Review: &ldquo;To review this expenses to date and discuss plans for the next phase of the project.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Meeting with Sales Team</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very generic as to what this person&rsquo;s role is but of course, this is all stuff designed to be glanced at for a couple of seconds if at all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a monthly entry for &ldquo;Pancake Breakfast&rdquo; at &ldquo;St. Mary&rsquo;s&rdquo; but I couldn&rsquo;t find any such place in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area">Bay Area</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contacts">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#contacts" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Contacts
</h2><p>There are 238 contact entries provided in two formats: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">VCF</a> and <a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/abbu">ABBU</a></p>
<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="contacts.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Contacts app visible on the author&amp;rsquo;s computer. A contact entry for Shota Aoyagi is selected. They have an iCloud email and allegedly live in Rochester, New York. Their contact card has a stock photo."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>The vast majority of contacts have addressed all across the United States of America with a handful that have addresses in Australia.</p>
<p>Given I live in New Zealand, I&rsquo;m guessing that demo units have a handful of regionalised entries.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t determine any link between the contact entries and other categories ie; no one from the Contacts list appears in any of the Calendar entries or in the Summer Garden Party attendee list that we&rsquo;ll be covering later on.</p>
<p>That said, I did google a number of the names and they all appear to be Apple employees in some capacity but with stock avatars and made up contact details of course.</p>
<h2 id="notes">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#notes" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Notes
</h2><p>These were loaded as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)">Apple Notes</a> but there&rsquo;s no standard format so they were all exported as PDFs. They&rsquo;re mostly intact but some formatting got mangled in the process.</p>
<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="notes.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Preview app showing a PDF. The PDF is an exported Apple Note showing a sketch for a treehouse. The note is titled &amp;ldquo;Jake&amp;rsquo;s treehouse!!&amp;rdquo;"  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>There&rsquo;s a note for <code>After-school activities for Jake</code> containing a checklist of sports so presumably this person is helping their son to decide on a sport. Interestingly, one of the entries is &ldquo;Footy&rdquo; which is a slang term for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_rules_football">Australian rules football</a> so I guess this note is localised a little bit.</p>
<p>It seems this person is building a back porch based on the <code>Back porch dimensions</code> note with another title <code>Garden proposal from our architect</code> which details where to lay out plants around their &ldquo;back patio&rdquo;. I would note that porch isn&rsquo;t really a term used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania">Oceania</a>.</p>
<p>Keeping with the renovation theme, we also have notes for <code>Trees/Plants for front garden</code>, <code>Things to do for salsa garden</code>, <code>New dishwasher options</code>, <code>Living room remodel ideas</code>, <code>Kitchen</code> (renovation) and <code>Get at hardware store</code>.</p>
<p>While I noted before about the mention of &ldquo;Footy&rdquo;, there are a few holiday planning notes that are all in America. The note <code>Ideas for US reunion w/ Dave and crew</code> has an entry for New York City that reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We all met here and we all love this city, but maybe not the best choice for a week of catching up over old times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of the term &ldquo;this&rdquo; implies that the person writing these notes currently lives in New York City but a few notes contradict this idea because they feature measurements in centimetres. America is one of the few countries that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units">doesn&rsquo;t make use of the metric system</a> so this doesn&rsquo;t quite add up.</p>
<p>A few holiday notes seem to center around California which definitely lines up with the general Apple-adjacent locations that appear through the demo unit.</p>
<p>A note titled <code>Soccer practise times</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> contains practice times for Zoe and Ella who, in addition to Jake, are presumably the three children of the author of these notes.</p>
<p>The practice times mentioned take place at <a href="https://www.santaritaschool.org/santaritaes/6993-Address-Directions.html">Santa Rita School</a>, <a href="https://www.covingtonschool.org/ces/4740-About.html">Covington School</a> and <a href="https://www.losaltosca.gov/recreation/page/rosita-park">Rosita Park</a> which are all real places in <a href="https://www.losaltosca.gov/">Los Altos, California</a>.</p>
<p>If you check on a map, Los Altos is a short drive from Cupertino, which is home to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park">Apple&rsquo;s donut headquarters</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the above, most of the notes don&rsquo;t really tell us much about the author besides the fact that they have three kids it appears.</p>
<h2 id="numbers">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#numbers" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Numbers
</h2><p>There is a planning spreadsheet for a Summer Garden Party available as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(spreadsheet)">Numbers</a> file.</p>
<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="numbers.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Preview app displaying a preview of a Number spreadsheet. Visible is a planning document for a garden party which lists a number of hosts and guests. A number of tasks are planned to be done between June and July. There are 4 sheets in total."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>There isn&rsquo;t much to say about this other than it&rsquo;s a planning document for a party. I cross-referenced the names with the Contacts entries and while there were some shared names, I don&rsquo;t think they were the same people.</p>
<p>One thing I was able to infer was from a section on the &ldquo;Budget&rdquo; sheet titled &ldquo;Useful Contacts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It lists a number of party-related businesses such as &ldquo;Joe the Juggler&rdquo; and &ldquo;True Cook&rdquo; catering. All of the phone numbers feature area codes from around the New York area.</p>
<h2 id="pages">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#pages" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Pages
</h2><p>This is a document on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa">Leaning Tower of Pisa</a> created with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pages_(word_processor)">Pages</a>. It&rsquo;s available as a <code>.pages</code> file as well as a PDF export.</p>
<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="pages.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Preview app displaying a preview of a Pages document. Visible is a page about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It talks about the history of the tower and how it wasn&amp;rsquo;t always leaning."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>It appears to be a school report since it&rsquo;s relatively accessible and light on details. The cover page says that it&rsquo;s by &ldquo;Mariana Lin&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There is a &ldquo;Mariana Lin&rdquo; in the Contacts list but I can&rsquo;t say whether there&rsquo;s any relation since we know that the names features don&rsquo;t align with the contact details, being Apple employees.</p>
<h2 id="slides">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#slides" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Slides
</h2><p>This is a presentation on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> created with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(presentation_software)">Keynote</a> and available as a <code>.key</code> file.</p>
<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="slides.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Preview app displaying a preview of a Keynote slide. Visible is a picture of Old Faithful, a geyser at Yellowstone National Park. The slide talks about what makes geysers spew water."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>The presentation is attributed to Jamie Wong, Lauren Kerr and Greg Novick, none of whom appear in the Contacts listing.</p>
<p>I assume it&rsquo;s also meant to be a school presentation as it&rsquo;s pretty light on detail. I didn&rsquo;t check if there are any presenter notes but I&rsquo;m guessing there probably aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Interestingly, running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_(Unix)"><code>strings</code></a> across the file throws up a reference to <code>Data/GettyImages-451901451-8851.mov</code> so it might include a video which would explain the beefy 236.5MB file size. I couldn&rsquo;t tell where it features from using Preview and I don&rsquo;t currently have Keynote installed.</p>
<h2 id="maps">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#maps" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Maps
</h2><p>The installed version of Apple Maps contained 25 locations saved which were exported as a <a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/webloc">webloc</a> file that can be imported into Apple Maps.</p>
<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="maps.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Maps app. A map collection titled &amp;ldquo;iPad Demo Unit Places&amp;rdquo; is selected on the right. Visible in the main window is North America which depicts a number of bookmarked locations."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>You can actually view all of the locations on the web <a href="https://guides.apple.com/?ug=CglNeSBQbGFjZXMSDgiuTRCvqe7D1Ny%2B0c8BEg0Irk0Qz%2FvZ4ZWbx9tBEg4Irk0Q07KFg%2F%2FQ%2BrnQARIOCK5NEMeAvZu8zOeUtwESDQiuTRDI4rigp6nsmwoSDgiuTRDo%2Fqe%2FvObuqOkBEg0Irk0Q5K%2FmsO64yJlxEg0Irk0Q8ayI64Pohv4OEg0Irk0Q09rW7Kq%2BiJhkEg4Irk0Q4IWIktWzuN%2FrARIOCK5NEN%2FqnrONnc3%2FtQESDQiuTRDDnK%2Ffxefylm4SDgiuTRDO%2BLmCgoX4hIkBEg0Irk0QlqLPz%2B%2FCqu8kEg4Irk0Qxqnl%2FNTUhb3KARINCK5NEOjYh9WIyM7IQBINCK5NEMWgq%2BbIqN%2FzBBINCK5NELWBwaT3lZ7lFRINCK5NEOa0h4ye9qb3IhIOCK5NEL3vkc6h0JrS4wESDQiuTRCJidXtgZHQ4gQSDgiuTRCl45zH%2F5%2BYqfwBEg0Irk0Qs6KWyKqUs94NEg0Irk0Qy47O5vuQt5BgEg4Irk0Q8tnK55HulOvfARIOCK5NELKK3MOW3YeIhgE%3D">here</a> which is the link contained by the <code>webloc</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="photos">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#photos" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Photos
</h2><p>As mentioned at the start, there are a great deal of photos but a lot of useful metadata requires them to be loaded into Photos.</p>
<center>
  <figure>
    <img src="photos.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the macOS Finder app. Visible is a photo of a dog with metadata about the photo visible on the right side."  loading="lazy" />
  </figure>
</center><p>They all have their original metadata which is interesting since there are a range of iOS devices used to take photos, not that I could ever take photos that nice with my own phone.</p>
<p>There are 437 photos in total although upon a quick skim, there are actually a couple of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime_File_Format">mov</a> videos as well.</p>

  Conclusion
</h2><p>Overall, this post wasn&rsquo;t particularly interesting to create but I figure it&rsquo;s useful to capture since the odds of getting a demo unit are probably not that great.</p>
<p>Each category of file tends to have been created from the point of view of a single person so it&rsquo;d be interesting to know how much detail went into determining each persona in order to inform what the content should look like.</p>
<p>I also wonder what team would be in charge of preloading fake content onto a device. I guess it would fall into the realm of marketing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be kind funny telling your parents like &ldquo;Yeah, I make fake content for iPads&rdquo; or something.</p>
<p>Anyway, as mentioned, I&rsquo;m glad to finally cross this project off my list and delete these files from my desktop so they&rsquo;ll stop judging me.</p>
<p>Once again, you can download all of the files referenced in this post <a href="https://archive.org/details/i-pad-demo-backup">over on the Internet Archive</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
