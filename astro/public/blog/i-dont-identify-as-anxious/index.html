    <p>This is my <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20171213">epic treatise</a> on the things that have been troubling me for some time now.</p>
<p>Like all of my most personal blog posts, you can expect this one to be at times flippant, absurd and other big words that I have to Google just to double check that I have the meaning correct.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I thought I had written something a bit closer to home, as far as mental health but it turns out that my <a href="https://utf9k.net/blog/let-your-streaks-end-naturally">previous attempts</a> were much more abstract than I remember.</p>
<p>On some level, I write this for myself with the naive thought that I can capture all these feelings in a bottle and discard them, not unlike a <a href="https://oxsci.org/can-a-camera-capture-your-soul/">camera stealing a soul</a>. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll read this in future but really, I take some small comfort that perhaps this will be a useful barrier break for anyone who has a false idea of me in their head.</p>
<p>Whatever I may have been able to live up to so far, this is hopefully proof enough that &ldquo;success&rdquo; by whatever means you define it is built on top of a great deal of well, whatever <em>this</em> is, I don&rsquo;t enjoy it.</p>
<p>Anyway, that should be enough of a pretentious introduction to shoo away anyone with a short attention span.</p>
<p>As of late, I have had a handful of panic attacks. I don&rsquo;t think I use that word lightly. The feeling is that my entire body goes nuclear hot, where I&rsquo;m borderline sweating. I might be shaking physically and usually I end up vomiting just due to the amount of nervous shaking upsets my stomach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not very nice! It kinda sucks!</p>
<p>This has only happened a few times in the past 6 months or so which is actually very rare but there&rsquo;s a bit of a catch.</p>
<p>From time to time, and today as I write this, I&rsquo;ll catch myself remembering those feelings. It&rsquo;s sort of like a mind virus. You can ever so slightly remember the feeling and then you can start to imagine yourself feeling it again. You feel a light flush. Oh no, it&rsquo;s back isn&rsquo;t it? It was always coming back. It was inevitable.</p>
<p>These are things that aren&rsquo;t true but the trick that I am still learning is to quieten those voices. I don&rsquo;t even think telling them to go away is the right approach. They&rsquo;re all valid things that are worth accepting while pushing back on the idea that they are set in stone.</p>
<p>It would perhaps be easy to &ldquo;think positive&rdquo; but so much of this all feels like it&rsquo;s subconscious as far as I can tell. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not but I just can&rsquo;t hear the voice that is causing all this. How can I &ldquo;win&rdquo; a battle when I can&rsquo;t even see the battlefield or my opponent. Well, again for the me 2 paragraphs ago, it isn&rsquo;t a battle is it.</p>
<p>These feelings are me and I am these feelings but I don&rsquo;t have to lay down and let them run rampant. It&rsquo;s easier to say that when you have a clear head.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should go over some specifics:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 28 as I write this and I assume part of this stems from anxiety about turning 30. Turning 30 itself doesn&rsquo;t scare me but there are all these little things in my head that I think I associate with having &ldquo;made it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Already this is stupid. I have a good paying job and I&rsquo;m (allegedly) respected at work. I have minimal to no debt and I can toot my horn about having gone the hard route of not getting a degree. What does making it even mean? I have very little to genuinely worry about each day.</p>
<p>I got my restricted drivers license (Stage 2 of 3) when I was about 16 but I put off my final test so I haven&rsquo;t driven for like 12 years. Part of me probably feels like I need to resolve all this so I can be self sufficient and all that. Successful people drive don&rsquo;tcha know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m single but I&rsquo;ve always been happy with my own company. Haven&rsquo;t I? We had a lot of good times right? I never thought I minded but all of a sudden, it can get awfully lonely when you&rsquo;re going through all this. It&rsquo;s scary to live alone and you freak out at night. There&rsquo;s no one around to talk to. Minutes can feel like hours and hours like weeks. Sleeping it all off would be a wonder except your body is primed to the brim with adrenaline so cross that off the list. I got a little teary writing this.</p>
<p>I can only imagine that these things are all in there somewhere contributing to this troubling period. You&rsquo;ll be great and things are normal but suddenly you remember that you remember that you remember and it&rsquo;s the darkest few hours of your waking existence. Why is this happening again? If I can just find the answer, will it leave me alone?</p>
<p>The hardest answer, when I think over all the things that frighten me, is that I have to do all of this <em>waves hands</em> for the next 70 years or more. I think that only to rebut myself in the same sentence with &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so bad about that? There are so many things to see and do!&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the feeling of dread persisting at its core, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an anxious person? I don&rsquo;t identify as such but factually, that might be correct? I don&rsquo;t know, is it anxiety? It&rsquo;s irrational for sure. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m scared that I&rsquo;m scared and I don&rsquo;t know where it starts and ends.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d tackle it normally. I had some more severe bouts that were exponentially worse back when I wrote <a href="https://utf9k.net/blog/ride-the-curve">Ride the Curve</a>. By all accounts, I&rsquo;ve almost won, right? The symptoms are a whisper of what they were and the distance between them is ever shorter but when it pops up, I just want to give up.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;ll ask my doctor if I can go back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escitalopram">what helped break me out last time</a>. I don&rsquo;t take any pride in fighting mental illness on hard mode. I don&rsquo;t wish it on anyone.</p>
<p>I dunno, I&rsquo;ll go about my day and things are great. Great is a strong word. Things are fine. Maybe I need more novelty in my life. It&rsquo;s the remmebering that this whole ordeal exists that opens the door ever so slightly for doubt to creep in. It could happen again so why wouldn&rsquo;t it, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been even stronger in reassuring myself that there are so many possibilities and that it&rsquo;s just my brain playing tricks but it&rsquo;s exhausting. Trying to self-monitor your own thoughts is exhausting. Your brain is effectively playing dual roles where you&rsquo;re watching yourself in third person.</p>
<p>Writing this has made me go up and down a bit where I&rsquo;m a little jittery but who knows, that could just be the cold that&rsquo;s creeping in and I&rsquo;m unintentionally feeding the nuclear fire with all these inputs that are unrelated. While things are quiet, I think I&rsquo;ll go to bed early. Napping is great. I wish I had more time this afternoon but I don&rsquo;t want to risk staying up. A thought creeped in that today was going to be one of the very bad ones. Let&rsquo;s hope it isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>If you read this far, I appreciate the effort. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be fine in the long run. While all these emotions were fresh, I wanted to capture them down since they&rsquo;re hard to explain. I don&rsquo;t even know if any of this makes sense since I write these sorts of posts off the cuff with no editing.</p>
