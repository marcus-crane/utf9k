# Time Dilation
04 July 2021

A more accurate title would probably be something like &#34;Time Inflation&#34; but I think &#34;Time Dilation&#34; sounds cooler.

Whenever I&#39;m planning a trip anywhere, often just across town, I tend to tack on an extra portion of time. Usually just 10 or 15 minutes as a bit of a buffer and depending on the mode of transport, it tends to get eaten up.

The trouble is that I don&#39;t really go back and re-evaluate how long it takes to get places. The next time I plan a trip, I tack on an extra portion of time. Usually just 10 or 15 minutes and... hold on a minute, didn&#39;t we already account for it?

I&#39;m pretty sure there are some things that I just don&#39;t even bother doing at all because I&#39;ve built this big time sink out of it when in reality, it won&#39;t take very long at all.

I remember taking the bus somewhere not that long ago and I was surprised that it only took a few minutes.

Well, yes, buses like most vehicles are quite fast on land but I guess my perception of time got a bit mangled somewhere along the track.

The irony of this of course, is that I waste large swathes of time checking the same five websites for updates, which I didn&#39;t really class as procrastination until recently.

There&#39;s not really a moral to the story or anything like that but re-evaluating what you think you know from time to time can never hurt.
