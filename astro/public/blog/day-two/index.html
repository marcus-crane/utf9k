    <p>I&rsquo;ve recently started as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at <a href="https://lightspeedhq.com/">Lightspeed</a> which means that it&rsquo;s time for the sequel to <a href="/blog/day-one">Day One</a>.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, I write a new post summing up the excitement and concerns I have whenever I start a new job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually sure if I&rsquo;ve ever explicitly noted that this is intended to be an ongoing series but yeah, ideally I write a new entry every time I start a new job going forward.</p>
<p>The idea is that I can look back and laugh at how much I did or didn&rsquo;t know. I realise that from the shoes of a beginner, it&rsquo;s easy to assume that long timers are magically gifted or Just Knew It All so in the event I make it somewhere interesting, this generally serves as proof that I had my doubts along the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually quite overdue with this entry since I&rsquo;m a little over a week into my new job already. I&rsquo;ll probably keep it kind of brief as well since I keep staying up late<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but I did make a couple of quick notes that I&rsquo;ll try to address.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<h2 id="interviewing">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#interviewing" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Interviewing
</h2><p>I actually don&rsquo;t mind interviewing so much these days but I do dread the idea of getting some overly technical, google-esque interview. I never took computer science<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> so if you ask me about B-tree&rsquo;s or whatever then I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, an interview prior to the ones with Lightspeed had me trying to write a sudoku solver. I gave it a crack but I didn&rsquo;t have much to show so 10 minutes before I end, I just ended it early to save myself the humiliation. That said, I pretty confidently said that I don&rsquo;t enjoy this stuff, I&rsquo;m comfortable saying as much and it doesn&rsquo;t reflect what I do day to day anyway.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I got to show a bit of everything across the stack in the Lightspeed interview with even a bit of frontend polish just for kicks :)</p>
<p>It definitely wasn&rsquo;t required but I opted to spend a bit of time on it. It&rsquo;s good practice for sprucing up my website anyway.</p>
<h2 id="my-first-day">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#my-first-day" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  My first day
</h2><p>These posts don&rsquo;t generally show when I&rsquo;ve started but it&rsquo;s probably a bit more appropriate (and relevant) of a timespan as my career progresses.</p>
<p>I had a poke around a bunch of Slack channels and was in two minds.</p>
<p>Firstly: wow, there&rsquo;s some really cool best practice stuff going on. Secondly: Ahh geez, everyone is definitely going to be smarter than me and doing well crafted stuff while I&rsquo;m super rusty.</p>
<p>Thankfully everyone is really nice and the onboarding has been pretty comprehensive.</p>
<h2 id="slos">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#slos" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  SLOs
</h2><p>Funnily enough, I saw a bunch of SLO monitors and my eyes probably dilated a bit.</p>
<p>Back at <a href="https://www.xero.com/nz/">Xero</a>, my team helped push the introduction of SLOs and I was in the SLO space for the better part of a year and a half and I still feel like I&rsquo;ve forgotten all of it in some capacity, haha.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really stupid like I&rsquo;ve run 3 part workshops on SLOs + alerting, helped teams instrument their products and my brain is still like &ldquo;I&quot;m very unqualified in this space&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this happens with most every domain anyway. Once I get back into it and brush up on source material again, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll remember all the niche details.</p>
<p>I still such at math, and by extension statistics and what not though.</p>
<p>Realistically, I&rsquo;m probably just scared that people will ask me questions on the spot I won&rsquo;t have the answers to, as if that&rsquo;s how it would go down. I also have an entire team I&rsquo;m part of so that&rsquo;s a dumb story to tell yourself.</p>
<h2 id="work-life-balance">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#work-life-balance" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Work life balance
</h2><p>This time around, I&rsquo;m definitely focusing on clocking in and out near enough on time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say I dislike my job, quite the opposite in fact. Thinking that the more hours you do magically correlates to more productivity is a lie. Productivity in general is a lie anyway. I have enough green cubes on Github without even trying, thank you very much.</p>
<p>My thoughts on this currently would just be a regurgitation of <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books">Four Thousand Weeks</a> by Oliver Burkeman.</p>
<p>It looks like a self help book but it&rsquo;s not. Just a reminder that always striving towards things, for the sake of &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;, is not a good idea generally. It&rsquo;s worth a read!</p>
<h2 id="job-titles">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#job-titles" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Job titles
</h2><p>It took me about a good week or so to put the &ldquo;Senior&rdquo; prefix in my bio and even then, I self-deprecatingly tacked &ldquo;(allegedly)&rdquo; on the end.</p>
<p>I think of myself as a Junior Senior, in that I just acquired this title but I guess it was bestowed upon me by passing a test so I guess I earned it?</p>
<p>I dunno, I feel the same and I often forget that I&rsquo;ve quote unquote made it.</p>
<p>I try not to think about it and remember that there&rsquo;s a whole team I&rsquo;m part of.</p>
<h2 id="the-team">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#the-team" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  The team
</h2><p>They&rsquo;re all really nice people that I can&rsquo;t fault or have any reservations about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to consciously be a little bit more myself by bringing the sillier aspects to work such as my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumamon">Kumamon</a> obsession.</p>
<p>As an example, I really enjoy Kumamon but even more, I find the contrast of &ldquo;an industry professional&rdquo; being a big fan of a cute Japanese bear even funnier. I imagine it&rsquo;s weirdly jarring but I also like that it forcefully breaks any illusion of being unapproachable or overly serious.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my less serious aspects like shitposting people (although never punching down or sideways) via DMs have ended up being helpful for bridging teams who don&rsquo;t communicate so easily. You can get to know individuals and figure out how to build ties with common elements.</p>
<p>Everyone can equally laugh at my Kumamon obsession while knowing that I&rsquo;m in on the joke for example. Maybe it helps ultimately build a squillion dollar product that ultimately would have fallen apart if things were too serious.</p>
<p>I dunno, I just want to build useful software and learn things anyway. Getting too invested into any single business, that may ultimately collapse at the whim of a newly-installed post-IPO board, is a bit of a mistake waiting to happen so just enjoy it while it lasts :)</p>
<h2 id="now-what">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#now-what" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Now what
</h2><p>I&rsquo;m still onboarding and perhaps I&rsquo;ll have more to write about career stuff. I think I&rsquo;ll be pretty happy here for a while and I&rsquo;ve got quite a bit to learn.</p>
<p>With lockdown again here in New Zealand and my <a href="/blog/ride-the-curve/">brief health issues earlier this year</a>, I had purposely decided not to think about work.</p>
<p>In fact, I was invited by the recruiter to interview so I never really plan to work here, it all came as quite a surprise!</p>
<p>The more technical posts I&rsquo;ve written, such as <a href="/blog/conditional-gitconfig/">Conditionally setting your gitconfig</a> and <a href="/blog/wsl2-vhd-issue/">Fixing a WSL2 VHD conversion issue</a>, continue to gain quite a bit of traffic which is interesting since I don&rsquo;t do very much promotion.</p>
<p>I have some vague intention to dig through manpages and what not to see what other niche things I can dig up. I don&rsquo;t intend to turn this site into some sort of &ldquo;Top 5 Git Commands&rdquo; hellhole.</p>
<p>Given that a few people reached out to me as a result, I&rsquo;m aware that more than a few seem to have gotten real value out of problems that I was just solving for myself ultimately.</p>
<p>The <a href="/questions">questions</a> section is still the place to go for brief, niche snippets but I would like to do some deep dives in future if anything useful comes out of them.</p>
<p>Whatever, I&rsquo;m just rambling at this point.</p>
<p>Until next time, see ya.</p>
