    <p>When the thought of having to give a presentation comes up, my usual reaction is that it might be fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given a decent handful of talks over the last few years to medium-ish audiences, with the largest being to around 100 people. For various reasons, the most recent ones have been via video calls but I&rsquo;ve done a couple in person and they don&rsquo;t feel that different in hindsight.</p>
<p>This is where I could start to hock my self help book<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and say &ldquo;Imagine the audience in their underwear&rdquo; but instead, why not dump out my brain on paper so that you too, for the low low price of $0, can also think about presentations upside down.</p>
<hr />
<p>My general threshold for being &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; with giving a talk is about 10 or more people, where I&rsquo;m kinda awful when it comes to groups greater than 1 person.</p>
<p>As for why that is, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine in a group of a few people, you stand out a lot more if you aren&rsquo;t say much (or are saying a lot!) with the best way to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; being to act normal.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t the same apply for a group where you&rsquo;re centre stage? It does I&rsquo;m sure but it&rsquo;s easy to imagine the group as a whole not paying attention to what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a safe bet that it&rsquo;s a reflection of my time in school, doing English class speeches where students, myself included, would zone out while someone had to give their presentation, even if it didn&rsquo;t feel like it to the presenter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, I should be overly clear here and say that this line of thought should not be taken seriously! It can be a useful tool but if you start to genuinely believe no one cares, that becomes dangerous the further you go.</p>
<p>The reality is that no one would turn up if they weren&rsquo;t interested, or wanting to support your output and you shouldn&rsquo;t doubt it.</p>
<p>In my mind, I put it in the same category as receiving complements where my initial reaction is to downplay them, partly out of embarrassment from receiving attention and partly because it doesn&rsquo;t happen regularly meaning it&rsquo;s not normalised for me. Feeling that way doesn&rsquo;t make it any less accurate or make you any less deserving of it however!</p>
<hr />
<p>Back to our fantasy worldview where we falsely believe no one is paying attention.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I always try to make sure the talk I&rsquo;m giving is something I would find interesting myself. In this view of things, I&rsquo;m the only one hearing myself talk which means I want to make sure I don&rsquo;t get bored of what I have to say.</p>
<p>Put another way, I try to give a talk that my past self would enjoy.</p>
<p>Going a step further, you might even imagine that the talk itself is besides the point. It&rsquo;s an artefact that you&rsquo;ll be discarding, with the fun part being the research process. It&rsquo;s like free motivation to look into something that you otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have found interesting.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The main underlying idea is to expect nothing with any response being a positive.</p>
<p>If you get a positive response, then great!</p>
<p>If you get a neutral response, you didn&rsquo;t lose (or gain) anything and likely learned a bunch on top of +5 Presentation EXP</p>
<p>Getting a negative response is unlikely given the vast majority of people don&rsquo;t like confrontation. In the rare event it does happen, it sounds like you made something that compelled someone to have an opinion which is a strange win if you think about it.</p>
<p>This should all be taken with a large pinch of salt (and therapy?) but used in the right way, it can be a handy story to tell yourself.</p>
<p>Merely saying &quot;	Don&rsquo;t worry about it&quot; is easy but getting to a place where you can believe it, even for a short while is the hardest part of all.</p>
