    <p>This isn&rsquo;t a post that I&rsquo;ve outlined before hand, or even really considered in any particular depth. I&rsquo;m just making up this post, and it&rsquo;s structure as I type.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&rsquo;ve got a few points on my whiteboard that made something click, along with some thoughts that have been frustrating me for a little bit now.</p>
<p>I like to use <a href="https://exist.io">Exist</a>, a service for collecting personal data. It&rsquo;s run a nice Australian duo and I have no issues with the service. All of the data collection is automated, and is explicitly authorised using regular OAuth.</p>
<p>Having all of that data consolidated in one place is nice.</p>
<p>I still feel like I could be doing more with it.</p>
<p>I could easily too, since I can export all that data at any point, and play with it or fetch certain subsets via their API.</p>
<p>On a slightly different note, it has the ability to track my day manually. I can write a short note of how I&rsquo;m feeling, a rating of my mood from 1 - 5, and also I can add tags to reflect what I did during that day.</p>
<p>Easy enough and I can observe trends over time as more data is gathered.</p>
<p>This post is not about data collection. Nothing here is malicious just to be clear.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t updated my mood, tags and so on for a few days now and I keep missing it. It&rsquo;s an understandable side effect of being stuck inside due to a global pandemic.</p>
<p>The more I really think about it, I start to realise that there is a compounding effect that&rsquo;s very subtle.</p>
<p>I start to feel back because I&rsquo;m missing out on that data.</p>
<p>I feel guilty because the picture I&rsquo;m trying to capture is now missing some snippets of data. It&rsquo;s no longer a continuous streak. I could just input from today onwards but there&rsquo;s a little bit of guilt that is prompting me to backfill those days.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a weird self guilt that I&rsquo;m not maintaining a dataset that&rsquo;s as close to perfect as I can manage.</p>
<p>Ironic since I&rsquo;m missing that data since the first 24 years of my life but this would be the same feeling if I would journalling in a notebook and missed a day.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s two things here I think I&rsquo;ve identified: I have a bunch of data and I could be doing more interesting things with it, and I have another bunch of data but I&rsquo;m not keeping it &ldquo;complete&rdquo;… even though I&rsquo;m not looking back at it.</p>
<p>I could though! In some hypothetical future where I stop being reactionary, actually relax and review what I&rsquo;ve got collected.</p>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m tempted to just throw away all that data and relieve myself of my self imposed burden to keep that dataset up to date, day after day.</p>
<p>The data is becoming a massive mental overhead, and arguably an emotional liability.</p>
<p>I suppose we expect, and hope that companies treat our data as a liability. While it&rsquo;s obviously an asset to me, there&rsquo;s no reason why upkeeping that data isn&rsquo;t also incurring a debt of sorts. Generating data is easy but actually recording it and auditing it would of course be some sort of investment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that last sentence actually reflects that I&rsquo;m trying to say properly but I&rsquo;m going to leave this as is, given I&rsquo;m writing it purely off the cuff with no edits.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>I think all of my filesystems are mental liabilities at this point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much crap scattered across my home desktop, home laptop, work laptop, phone? Images, documents, text snippets?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all crap that slowly piles up in my mind.</p>
<p>I should be cleaning it all up.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should turn off my desktop icons for starters but that doesn&rsquo;t really address my issue.</p>
<p>I just want to stop accumulating crap. How can I be a digital minimalist?</p>
<p>My work Google Drive is full of stuff I&rsquo;ve just dumped in there and never looked at again.</p>
<p>There are shared drives I&rsquo;ve been invited to, or requested access to, telling myself that I&rsquo;ll make use of all of this wonderful information.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s wonderful, I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s too much information, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m getting out of this is that if I haven&rsquo;t used something, or can&rsquo;t justify keeping it, I need to just delete it?</p>
<p>There are plenty of data sets I&rsquo;ve requested thinking I&rsquo;ll use them for cool projects but I never get around to it. Traffic data, parking data, data for this, data for that. It all becomes more and more of a liability in the back of your mind because of all of the things you &ldquo;could&rdquo; have done or are sitting unfinished.</p>
<p>Bah!</p>
<p>My bookmarks are just the same. I&rsquo;ve got a stockpile of articles which might be amazing or they might be a waste of time. The more that piles up too, geez, when I actually create stuff instead of consuming content, hahaha</p>
<p>Picking and choosing is very hard.</p>
<p>Dropping books is another thing I really need to learn how to do. I&rsquo;ll start one, get partway in, get bored but still slog through it. Sometimes I&rsquo;m pleasantly surprised but the idea of having it marked as &ldquo;stalled&rdquo; in my mind is almost a worse fate.</p>
<p>Open loops is probably the keyword here?</p>
<p>How do you close them?</p>
<p>Is just removing something off a list satisfactory? Tell yourself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done with that book/show/codebase/movie/manga/article/course&rdquo; and then move on? Seems easier said than done?</p>
<p>Perhaps another contributor to all of this is generally using internet tools to track backlogs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="https://trakt.tv">Trakt</a> for example. No authority says &ldquo;Thou must finish all movies or shows they intend to watch&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s hard to not look at a list and wish to complete it.</p>
<p>Finishing one list, in one medium alone is essentially impossible in a human lifetime, let alone all mediums you might appreciate.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have any good answers but hopefully writing all of this down means I can point to some words when I want to express my frustration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts, if you&rsquo;ve got any suggestions. You can email me at marcus (at) utf9k.net.</p>
<p>You could of course use any other content method on my <a href="/about">about</a> but just make sure the medium is enough to express your thoughts.</p>
<p>This post wouldn&rsquo;t make a very good &ldquo;tweetstorm&rdquo; if you ask me.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
