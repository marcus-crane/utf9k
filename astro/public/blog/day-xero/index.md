# Day Xero
15 February 2018

Technically it&#39;s Day 1 of my new job, a Graduate Site Reliability Engineer at [Xero](https://www.xero.com/nz/) but it hasn&#39;t officially started since I&#39;m still on my way to the airport.

I told myself that when I finally got my first full time development position, I&#39;d write a big post mortem about how long it took, how many times I was rejected and all that but since I haven&#39;t (yet), this is my offering to the Content Overlords.

I don&#39;t even know if I actually slept last night because it felt like most of it was like &#34;Oh no, what have I actually learnt over the last year&#34; and other rude things from that pesky doubtful voice we all have.

Excuse me, you silly voice, I&#39;ll have you know that I&#39;ve used and/or fiddled with ahem

and let me tell you, MediaWiki is somethingâ€¦ special alright but it&#39;s solid!

I&#39;d be silly of course to think that somehow knowing a bunch of frameworks and languages will somehow mean I&#39;m set for life because that&#39;s nonsense talk. It&#39;s all about knowing picking the right tool for the right job, y&#39;know?

One of the things I&#39;d like to do more this year is reading more about actual software stories. I started reading [Dreaming in Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreaming_in_Code) earlier this year which seems to be a &#34;what not to do&#34; manual.

The author, Scott Rosenberg often veers so far into tangents that half the book feels more like a history lesson than development but that&#39;s good! Software won&#39;t save you, or the planet, on its own. You gotta focus on the people behind it and getting them working together as a proper team.

This post isn&#39;t actually about anything as you can tell. It&#39;s the [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) of posts. Well, that&#39;s not true since Seinfeld isn&#39;t actually about nothing, it&#39;s just a show without drama. It&#39;s supposed to just be regular life because your average person doesn&#39;t live out [Sex in the City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City) on a daily basis. I&#39;ve never actually seen that show though, it&#39;s just used as a punchline a lot.

I&#39;m sure if I look back at today, I&#39;ll wonder what I was even worried about. If you think about friends or coworkers, do you even really remember meeting them? It&#39;s like as soon as you properly know someone, you just kinda forget any awkward moments before your first interaction. I suppose it&#39;s like that with jobs. You just kinda turn up one day and, assuming you try your best, you just kinda slot in nicely as if you&#39;d been there the whole time.

Anyway, I better deploy this thing before my taxi gets here. It&#39;s still kinda crazy to me that I can just give away the [actual post file](https://github.com/marcus-crane/site/blob/95ae742bbf33662f4dd4cf284e463d0f9320c8d1/site/posts/blog/2018/2018-02-12-day-xero.md) you&#39;re reading with a few entries into a terminal. Yes, I had to manually make that link because this post even in the repo yet! That&#39;s like some kinda preemptive sharing, whoaaa mannnnn.

As someone who learnt piece by piece, pouring a bunch of hours into Right Click -&gt; View Page Source, it&#39;s nice to give my own stuff back. I can&#39;t remember who said it or when but someone once said something along the lines of &#34;I don&#39;t write code, I merely borrow it.&#34; Their point wasn&#39;t that they spend all day on Stack Overflow but rather that none of their ideas are truly original. Nothing is original because it&#39;s all inspired by things that came before.

Ok, ok, my time is actually almost up and while I&#39;m a bit freaked out that I&#39;ll be diving into my first full time software job after years of being a hobbyist, there&#39;s one thing that I try to remind myself. I might not truly know what I&#39;m doing but neither does anyone else.

As someone else once told me:

&gt; Adults are just kids who got older
