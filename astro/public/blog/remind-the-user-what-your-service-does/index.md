# Remind the user what your service does
01 June 2021

This goes out to anyone who does marketing for startups and businesses.

If you&#39;re about to announce something like an update for those on a waitlist or a big bang version 2, please include a reminder of what your service actually is?

I can&#39;t count the number of times I receive an email out of the blue saying &#34;Smergen is nearly here!&#34; only for me to scratch my head out of confusion.

A decent improvement is to just include screenshots (but not those vague &#34;big tech art&#34; things, real ones!)

The actual fix is just to include a one liner like &#34;Smergen - the app that lets you map public toilets&#34;.

To really drive it home, here&#39;s a masterclass in retaining the user from [nvUltra](https://nvultra.com)

If you can&#39;t take a few seconds to provide some context for what your announcement is about, I can&#39;t get excited or even bring myself to care.
