# Let your streaks end naturally
03 June 2021

Generally speaking, it&#39;s always a good idea to let your streaks end when the time is right.

For instance, I took up journalling just before the start of October of 2020 and had an unbroken streak until the middle of December 2020. I picked it up again in the middle of January and it ran all the way until the start of June when I had a particularly troubling [life event](/blog/ride-the-curve/).

Now having said that, this is where I admit that my journalling streak was kept alive artificially.

I didn&#39;t actually fill out each entry on each given day but instead, I would forget about it and backfill days (or even a week!) at a time. At that point, it should have become clear that the act of journalling, in and of itself, wasn&#39;t compelling enough to keep me interested.

As I sit back and think about it, it&#39;s probably fair to say that I was more invested in the aesthetics of keeping a journal more than the journal itself.

[Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) has a cool feature for [printing books](https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/769055-book-printing) and the idea of having a coffee table book[^coffeetable] was very cool but these are all side effects of journaling.

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s ok to pursue a habit as a means to the actual thing you want to achieve but just as long as you&#39;re aware of the potential pitfalls.

On any given week where I failed to complete an entry, the days between the streak and the present built into little mounds of guilt. Nothing bad mind you but just enough to think &#34;I need to backfill this entire week&#34; to keep the streak going. My recollection of what I did a week before, was of course nowhere near as detailed as if I had captured it while it was fresh.

Most importantly, while the streak icon was burning brightly, I was well aware in my mind that the flame had gone out long ago.

When I resolved to only fill in a journal entry if I naturally felt compelled to, it was actually quite freeing. I didn&#39;t have to think about the artificial guilt that comes with completionism[^completionism].

Funnily enough, some things I haven&#39;t decided to explicitly grow a streak in, such as reviewing [Readwise](https://readwise.io) bookmarks, have since developed into their own streaks naturally.

I&#39;m sure these too will end too when the time is right and that&#39;s completely fine.

Perhaps you could say the same of relationships too.

&lt;!--- Written with A.I in mind --&gt;

[^coffeetable]: Not that I actually have a coffee table, or lounge, mind you!

[^completionism]: A riduculous idea of course, since I&#39;m missing journal entries ranging from my birth to my 25th birthday. There&#39;s literally no way anyone can ever &#34;complete&#34; a journal or backfill the pages.
