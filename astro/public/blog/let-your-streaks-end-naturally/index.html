    <p>Generally speaking, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to let your streaks end when the time is right.</p>
<p>For instance, I took up journalling just before the start of October of 2020 and had an unbroken streak until the middle of December 2020. I picked it up again in the middle of January and it ran all the way until the start of June when I had a particularly troubling <a href="/blog/ride-the-curve/">life event</a>.</p>
<p>Now having said that, this is where I admit that my journalling streak was kept alive artificially.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t actually fill out each entry on each given day but instead, I would forget about it and backfill days (or even a week!) at a time. At that point, it should have become clear that the act of journalling, in and of itself, wasn&rsquo;t compelling enough to keep me interested.</p>
<p>As I sit back and think about it, it&rsquo;s probably fair to say that I was more invested in the aesthetics of keeping a journal more than the journal itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> has a cool feature for <a href="https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/769055-book-printing">printing books</a> and the idea of having a coffee table book<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was very cool but these are all side effects of journaling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s ok to pursue a habit as a means to the actual thing you want to achieve but just as long as you&rsquo;re aware of the potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>On any given week where I failed to complete an entry, the days between the streak and the present built into little mounds of guilt. Nothing bad mind you but just enough to think &ldquo;I need to backfill this entire week&rdquo; to keep the streak going. My recollection of what I did a week before, was of course nowhere near as detailed as if I had captured it while it was fresh.</p>
<p>Most importantly, while the streak icon was burning brightly, I was well aware in my mind that the flame had gone out long ago.</p>
<p>When I resolved to only fill in a journal entry if I naturally felt compelled to, it was actually quite freeing. I didn&rsquo;t have to think about the artificial guilt that comes with completionism<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, some things I haven&rsquo;t decided to explicitly grow a streak in, such as reviewing <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a> bookmarks, have since developed into their own streaks naturally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure these too will end too when the time is right and that&rsquo;s completely fine.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could say the same of relationships too.</p>

<p>A riduculous idea of course, since I&rsquo;m missing journal entries ranging from my birth to my 25th birthday. There&rsquo;s literally no way anyone can ever &ldquo;complete&rdquo; a journal or backfill the pages.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
