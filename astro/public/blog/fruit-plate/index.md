# Fruit Plate
02 November 2020

I ordered a fruit plate about 15 minutes ago.

$20 for a fruit plate and a chai latte is pretty egregious but I think I got a blog post out of it so perhaps it&#39;s worth it.

Also, plate is a misnomer because it came in a box but that&#39;s besides the point.

I had purchased an Apple Watch not so long ago based on the promise that &#34;Hey, maybe I&#39;ll leave my phone at home and be less logged on&#34;.

Until just the other day, Spotify streaming via cellular wasn&#39;t possible but it seems they expanded the reach of the Beta group and so now it is.

Given that was the last, and arguably most important feature I would want to truly ditch my phone, the &#34;dream&#34; is now a reality.

Of course, whether the dream has been realised is a different story, and I wouldn&#39;t go so far as it call it a &#34;false&#34; promise because it&#39;s really up to the user to follow through on it.

Anyway, none of that is neither here nor there.

I was sitting on what is effectively a picnic table, in so much as it was on concrete and I have no friends, and I got thinking about the promise of Getting Things Doneâ„¢

While I generally feel like shit, I got to diagnosing it a bit more given I didn&#39;t have a phone out to distract me. The link here is that I now just walk to the gym in the morning without it since I can stream Spotify. Thanks Sweden.

Anyway, I realised I haven&#39;t done a weekly review in about 2 weeks. I took a break... and then I guess a second break. I&#39;ve done plenty of weekly reviews so it&#39;s not like they&#39;re hard and often can be pretty handy.

The greater problem is that I seem to think I should be doing GTD. Well, actually the problem is really just one of productivity in general.

I&#39;m often always productive at work, as is most everyone of course. Productive outside of work? Hmm, maybe not so much. Should I be? Well, no. It&#39;s a cliche at this point to bring up the whole &#34;Person thinks they have to be productive because hustle culture is a thing&#34;.

I actually read a Gary Vaynerchuk book once when I was a teenager. I think he said caring about your customer is good or something.

Partly, I&#39;m not sure that relaxing is something I know how to do. I&#39;ve often joked about it but it&#39;s kind of true. If I&#39;m reading a book, it&#39;s usually for the naive hope that I&#39;ll take a bunch of notes and recycle it into something for my website. I&#39;ll often watch movies and tv shows, sure. I can&#39;t claim that going through a backlog is an extension of relaxing so much as it is completing a checklist though.

Perhaps to some extent, it&#39;s just learning how to drop things. Not doing something I don&#39;t really care about, and then remembering I didn&#39;t do that thing, is still another block in the pile.

I guess this is part of where GTD or any other &#34;productivity&#34; system falls down is that perhaps it assumes you&#39;re a reasonable person who gets up at a reasonable time.

I like to think such a thing wouldn&#39;t exist if David Allen used Twitter or got distracted 9 times a day by an ocean of Slack notifications.

Anyway, I should eat my fruit box so I can have energy to go and contribute to the economy or whatever
