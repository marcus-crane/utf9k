    <p>I ordered a fruit plate about 15 minutes ago.</p>
<p>$20 for a fruit plate and a chai latte is pretty egregious but I think I got a blog post out of it so perhaps it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>Also, plate is a misnomer because it came in a box but that&rsquo;s besides the point.</p>
<p>I had purchased an Apple Watch not so long ago based on the promise that &ldquo;Hey, maybe I&rsquo;ll leave my phone at home and be less logged on&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Until just the other day, Spotify streaming via cellular wasn&rsquo;t possible but it seems they expanded the reach of the Beta group and so now it is.</p>
<p>Given that was the last, and arguably most important feature I would want to truly ditch my phone, the &ldquo;dream&rdquo; is now a reality.</p>
<p>Of course, whether the dream has been realised is a different story, and I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as it call it a &ldquo;false&rdquo; promise because it&rsquo;s really up to the user to follow through on it.</p>
<p>Anyway, none of that is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>I was sitting on what is effectively a picnic table, in so much as it was on concrete and I have no friends, and I got thinking about the promise of Getting Things Done™</p>
<p>While I generally feel like shit, I got to diagnosing it a bit more given I didn&rsquo;t have a phone out to distract me. The link here is that I now just walk to the gym in the morning without it since I can stream Spotify. Thanks Sweden.</p>
<p>Anyway, I realised I haven&rsquo;t done a weekly review in about 2 weeks. I took a break&hellip; and then I guess a second break. I&rsquo;ve done plenty of weekly reviews so it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re hard and often can be pretty handy.</p>
<p>The greater problem is that I seem to think I should be doing GTD. Well, actually the problem is really just one of productivity in general.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often always productive at work, as is most everyone of course. Productive outside of work? Hmm, maybe not so much. Should I be? Well, no. It&rsquo;s a cliche at this point to bring up the whole &ldquo;Person thinks they have to be productive because hustle culture is a thing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I actually read a Gary Vaynerchuk book once when I was a teenager. I think he said caring about your customer is good or something.</p>
<p>Partly, I&rsquo;m not sure that relaxing is something I know how to do. I&rsquo;ve often joked about it but it&rsquo;s kind of true. If I&rsquo;m reading a book, it&rsquo;s usually for the naive hope that I&rsquo;ll take a bunch of notes and recycle it into something for my website. I&rsquo;ll often watch movies and tv shows, sure. I can&rsquo;t claim that going through a backlog is an extension of relaxing so much as it is completing a checklist though.</p>
<p>Perhaps to some extent, it&rsquo;s just learning how to drop things. Not doing something I don&rsquo;t really care about, and then remembering I didn&rsquo;t do that thing, is still another block in the pile.</p>
<p>I guess this is part of where GTD or any other &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; system falls down is that perhaps it assumes you&rsquo;re a reasonable person who gets up at a reasonable time.</p>
<p>I like to think such a thing wouldn&rsquo;t exist if David Allen used Twitter or got distracted 9 times a day by an ocean of Slack notifications.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should eat my fruit box so I can have energy to go and contribute to the economy or whatever</p>
