    <p>I went to get a haircut about 45 minutes before writing this post, and the internet went out briefly. I overheard one of the hair stylists say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird to think how much we rely on the internet, huh?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, this isn&rsquo;t a new thought, and this post is being made up as I write it but it&rsquo;s always an interesting thought.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first thing I heard when I walked in the door was &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in 2 seconds, the internet has just gone out&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To be quite clear, I like the hair stylist I go to. I hate haircuts so any observations are just that but naturally, I thought</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does that have to do with haircuts</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>I thought about it a bit while I was there and realised it must be quite hard to be a non-technical business owner.</p>
<p>For starters, when the internet &ldquo;goes out&rdquo;, all sorts of things start breaking of course. You can&rsquo;t reach your booking system. Perhaps people are booking still, and some managed service is confirming them automatically, but you have no visibility into your expected workflow for later that day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also not really giving proper attention to the people presently there either, since it&rsquo;s in the back of your mind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re non-technical after all, you don&rsquo;t really have a mental model of all of the devices in your building and how many of them depend on ethernet or a wireless access point.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you know roughly what does of course but there&rsquo;s plenty of things that are easy to get about since they… always just work?</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t actually any music, or rather it stopped playing at one point. Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed but lo and behold, Spotify does indeed require the internet.</p>
<p>They have mobile EFTPOS terminals that have no cables too so I wonder if they&rsquo;re running off of WiFi too. That makes them about as useful as a brick without those juicy packets.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyway, this post is partly me trying to sort through my spaghetti thoughts and I think there were two main things that popped into my head:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a business owner, just how many dependencies do you end up with that you don&rsquo;t properly understand?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder to what extent, slowly over time, you get introduced to the cooler, mobile EFTPOS terminal. Don&rsquo;t be tied down with all those cables, you could be trendy.</p>
<p>Ok, ok, I&rsquo;m being heavily sarcastic, no one actually drops however much on a whim for non-essentials but with the rise in internet-connected &ldquo;things&rdquo;, perhaps there ends up being an unavoidable Ship of Theseus type effect where one day, your entire business can be closed for the day if the internet goes out.</p>
<p>Even for business that seemingly have no real essential need for the internet, but get convinced about some cool new online booking system or whatever. I can imagine as &ldquo;internet&rdquo; niches dry up over time, ever more businesses will be convinced to dive into technology in order to create new niches.</p>
<p>The booking system that the hair stylist I used is some basic bootstrap thing with some dropdowns yet there&rsquo;s an entire business that makes &ldquo;premium hair salon booking systems&rdquo;. Perhaps the wildest part is that time is the bottleneck here, right?</p>
<p>Surely booking can&rsquo;t physically be any more complex than it was as a kid, when staff had paper-based agendas.</p>
<p>In this case, I&rsquo;m just talking about places with a comparable number of staff of course. You&rsquo;d want something a bit more scalable with tens or hundreds of staff but until we get hair stylists that rent out a warehouse for some sort of olympic hairdressing event, the problem space seems about the same to me as it ever did. What&rsquo;s the problem we solved here exactly?</p>
<p>At this point I&rsquo;m just ranting about technology but this does bring me around to my second question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there, or should there be, such a thing as technology risk assessment/dependency modelling for businesses?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This goes back to the mention of mental models but for your average business owner, I imagine you might not really understand that technology isn&rsquo;t a monolith? You&rsquo;ve got disciplines ranging from wild west code slinging to &ldquo;Just wrapped up a 7 month design trip visiting the wetlands of Croatia&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bootstrap is fine, I don&rsquo;t hate Javascript for keeping me hostage and Zuck can grill meats all he wants but I know for sure when I look at a barebones booking system and wonder &ldquo;So what do they do all day? This seems like a grad project&rdquo;, their customers most likely don&rsquo;t have the same point of view.</p>
<p>Taste in design isn&rsquo;t really a concern here but I can&rsquo;t help but wish there was some sort of crash course where people could work through hypotheticals like the above situation I described.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure what to say here other than you can&rsquo;t really avoid engineering a single point of failure if you don&rsquo;t even know what that is.</p>
<p>Also, if I was trying to run a business and focus on &ldquo;what actually matters&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d probably just think &ldquo;Sounds boring/complicated/nerd crap&rdquo; which is ironic given, you know, I&rsquo;m writing this post.</p>
<hr>
<p>Realistically, none of this matters. No one else noticed, or even cared, especially not enough to spend their entire lunch break writing over 70 something lines on hair styling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s perhaps something more to think about and I probably shouldn&rsquo;t publish this given how it&rsquo;s kind of half baked but maybe it&rsquo;ll inspire you to write something actionable and coherent.</p>
<p>Personally, I think if we still had 3.5mm jacks, I could have just streamed Spotify via mobile for them until the internet came back on. How&rsquo;s that for collective action?</p>
