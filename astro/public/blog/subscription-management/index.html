    <p>The title says it all really but I&rsquo;ll go into detail a little more.</p>
<p>One of the handiest tricks I ever discovered earlier last year, was to get a second debit card issued specifically just for subscriptions.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, I used to just have my primary account tied to my debit card, and a couple of others that weren&rsquo;t accessible through any physical means.</p>
<p>A few times, I would get a bit too eager to try out subscription services and slowly, my primary account would get eaten. Similarly, surprise yearly renewals would suddenly eat a portion of my bank account to my horror.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;fix&rdquo; for this was to transfer all of my money instantly out of my primary account and across to another savings account. I&rsquo;d keep a minimal amount on my card and perform transfers on the fly as I needed.</p>
<p>This actually caused me a lot of grief once when I was trying to check into a hotel while visiting America. My bank actually had maintenance on their mobile app so I was stuck with just shy of the required bank deposit and no way to access any of my money. Thankfully, the clerk let me pay it in the morning.</p>
<p>It got particularly bad when I joined a gym. They would do their debit charges on a Friday but I swear it never felt consistent. Sometimes it would be on a Saturday or it would be first thing Friday morning. More than a few times, I forgot or be late, causing both the charge to decline and myself to pay a dishonour fee as I didn&rsquo;t have enough.</p>
<p>Now, at this point, you may think that I should have been more vigilant in transfering across the required amount which brings us full circle. Sometimes I would perform a transfer for the required amount the night before&hellip; only for a subscription renewal to eat into the balance, causing a decline because what the heck, suddenly I don&rsquo;t have enough.</p>
<p>Anyway, it occured to me that when you break it down, there are two streams of charges: those that are controlled (ie I physically swipe my card) and those that I would call erratic. The latter are often a known quantity but soetimes they&rsquo;re a moving target, sometimes my dumb human brain forgets.</p>
<p>For the most part, the feeling is that of being inside of an interrogation room. That is to say, there&rsquo;s a kind of one way mirror where I don&rsquo;t really know what could jump out at any minute and eat my wallet.</p>
<p>So anyway, what I did was requested a second debit card that I use entirely just for subscriptions and the like. I don&rsquo;t do anything fancy, just roughly eyeball how much is expected to go out based on last month and transfer it in. Every week or so I&rsquo;ll move amounts in and out based on how close to the mark I&rsquo;ve been.</p>
<p>A very handy side effect is that you&rsquo;ve also got a clear view into your recurring expenses. Often times you can forget you&rsquo;re subscribed to something for a long time because the transactions are buried amongst your life stuff.</p>
<p>With your subscription only bank account, you&rsquo;ve got a continuous feed of things you&rsquo;re subscribed to and hey, you didn&rsquo;t even need to pay a SaaS company to figure it out!</p>
