    <p>It&rsquo;s 6:30pm on my 25th birthday and I&rsquo;ve been reflecting a bit on what I&rsquo;ve managed to accomplish so far. While this isn&rsquo;t a post about that, there&rsquo;s no better time to assess the state of my personal site and where I&rsquo;d like to go forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#the-current-state" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  The current state
</h2><p>At present, my blog isn&rsquo;t really best effort. I&rsquo;d like to write more things but I never really make it an actual goal. I&rsquo;d say the biggest reason is that I&rsquo;ve been wrapped up in work side projects instead of my own personal side projects so I&rsquo;ll be looking to stop doing that.</p>
<p>My site has gone through plenty of iterations, with the current being a static site, built with Hugo and hosted on Netlify. It works but it&rsquo;s not exactly how I&rsquo;d like it.</p>
<p>Along the way, pages have disappeared. There used to be a projects page which never got filled in properly. There was also an archive of reviews I wrote years back. They&rsquo;re still there but not publically exposed anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="where-id-like-to-get-to">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#where-id-like-to-get-to" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Where I&rsquo;d like to get to
</h2><p>I always seem to fumble around a lot with Markdown. It works great but there&rsquo;s always things missing I wish I had. Some markdown libraries support tables while some don&rsquo;t, or defer to extensions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come across Asciidoc recently and it seems to be exactly what I&rsquo;d like. Even as a general document format, it seems pretty handy.</p>
<p>Hugo does have support for it, but it runs with some hardcoded flags that are annoying. It requires a Hugo heading block so you might get a mix like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>title: <span style="color:#bd93f9">25</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>date: 2019-08-19
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>tags: <span style="color:#ff79c6">[</span>meta<span style="color:#ff79c6">]</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span> <span style="color:#bd93f9">25</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Marcus Crane &lt;marcus@utf9k.net&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>v1.0, 2019-08-19
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>It&#39;s 6:30pm...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This works fine but I&rsquo;d like to stick to just one single format. Mixing metadata just for Hugo and metadata just for Asciidoc is annoying so I&rsquo;ll have a look into that. Asciidoc itself provides pretty much everything I&rsquo;d want out the box for a static site. The remainder is just building the category pages and so on, which I don&rsquo;t necessarily need a fully fledged framework for.</p>
<h2 id="some-topics-id-like-to-look-into">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#some-topics-id-like-to-look-into" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Some topics I&rsquo;d like to look into
</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve got a list of topics I sometimes keep handy but I haven&rsquo;t invested much time into exploring.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, there&rsquo;s some stuff I&rsquo;d like to write about and others I&rsquo;d have to research. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A writeup of all the iterations of my site with pros and cons (eg; Django, Flask, Hugo, Jekyll etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A comparison of &ldquo;Prepay SMS UIs&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A little while ago I changed cell providers (and then switched back). Topping up credit using SMS based menus was fascinating since it&rsquo;s like this whole web.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to model the various states you can get into and just talk about text based UIs in general</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps there&rsquo;d be some lessons from there that could be reused in chat based UIs or whatever the flavour of the month is with Slack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donating to those who are homeless / on the streets in the future</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With plenty of things moving to Paywave type technology, what will happen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personally, I rarely/never carry cash on me anymore so I couldn&rsquo;t give spare change even if I wanted</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>My own personal de-googlify post</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I recently deleted my Google account after finding a replacement for YouTube (exported my subscriptions as an RSS feed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most other services I had a replacement for, or never used them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently running LineageOS with a custom location provider so pretty much no reliance on Google stuff for Android</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One missing piece then I&rsquo;d be ready to write about how it&rsquo;s worked for (quite well actually)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hardline &ldquo;my freedoms&rdquo; so I still run eg; Instagram and what not. The idea isn&rsquo;t to be pure but find a balance between convenience and privacy (as much as that&rsquo;s a thing hah)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Github vs Gitlab</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I recently imported some stuff to Gitlab. I haven&rsquo;t invested much time into it but it seems promising given how many features they&rsquo;ve developed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They could all just be quite shallow and not very reliable however.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing my &ldquo;every day carry&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I recently managed to merge my keys, cards and public transport tag into one which has been working quite well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d always fancied the idea of not having a wallet but couldn&rsquo;t really see how it would work</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Picking mediums</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Us humans seem to be bad at picking mediums. We do tweetstorms about political policy or complex issues rather than doing long form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some cases, shorter mediums are popular but the medium itself shapes the content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To fit eg; Twitter&rsquo;s message size, you&rsquo;re going to simplify ideas as much as you can (but no more) but nuance may get lost in the process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-things-to-add">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#other-things-to-add" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Other things to add
</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>A proper projects page</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got some stuff I can probably put up but it would also give me a reason to focus on personal projects more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring back the reviews page</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d like to have something (automation idk) embed cover art and what not for reviews so they look a bit more official</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps a stats page</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I used to have this at one point which would pull information from various places</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was a nice excuse to play around with technology I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with like Redis or Celery queues</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting the whole dynamic vs static thing</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Part of me wants to go back to dynamic all the time as an excuse to learn new technologies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe a mix of the two is would suit me best. Just use asciidoc (via a subprocess) to render pages / store them statically while dynamically building the list type pages</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-there">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#how-do-i-get-there" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  How do I get there
</h2><p>I just gotta start leaving my laptop at work or else I get tempted to work on work technologies honestly. None of the above is hard but it&rsquo;s easy to get side tracked or want to finish off something.</p>
<p>In this case, there&rsquo;s no requirement for me to do so. Things just happen to cross over with my interests.</p>
<p>Anyway, this post is me committing to changing that, and also having a list of things to look into before I forget.</p>
<p>Perhaps we&rsquo;ll do a 26 this time next year. On that note.</p>
<h2 id="some-final-thoughts">
  <a class="jumplink" href="#some-final-thoughts" aria-hidden="true">¶</a>
  Some final thoughts
</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>This site is essentially my portfolio but I don&rsquo;t care to make it particularly professional. The style is &ldquo;Things past me would enjoy stumbling upon&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While there may be some posts about specialised topics, none of them should be sacred and should attempt to be readable by anyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s that scale that tells you if text is at a 3rd grade reading level etc. That could be an interesting thing to run over some posts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I rarely look at analytics. They don&rsquo;t have any bearing on what I write. Comments I don&rsquo;t mind but they&rsquo;re not really integrated well. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get rid of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d like the site to be a bit more nice to look at. I tried the whole dark scheme for a bit and it&rsquo;s good but not quite perfect. Maybe I even support both?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reference books seem to have some cool layouts. I could probably pull some inspiration from them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve fallen out of love with menus. If I do have then, breadcrumb style things might be a way to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to look back in a few years and see a bunch of stuff that reflects who I was, and how much I know, at that point in time. That&rsquo;s partly why having a format that lasts is important since Hugo may disappear one day for all I know.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>
