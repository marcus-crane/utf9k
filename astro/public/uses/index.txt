For the unaware, this is inspired by the /uses page idea

Text Editor I flip flop a lot in this area.

For most things, I reach for Visual Studio Code which I mostly have not set up properly.

I aspire to get back to using Doom Emacs now that I have discovered the much improved emacs-mac distribution.

For Golang projects of a much larger size, I often reach for GoLand

When I need to view extremely large files or I just want to do a quick edit, I’ll often reach for Sublime Text although it’s just using the stock configuration.

Terminal Currently, I use iTerm2 with Berkeley Mono Regular 14 and the Dracula colour scheme.

Everything else is stock and unconfigured.
