Well, sorta.

As some of you may know, Grand Theft Auto V finally released for PC. I think it’s a really nice port which has so far definitely been worth the dollaroos I spent on it.

Anyway, this is just a filler post to say that I haven’t finished anything due to GTA V so come back next week!

Things will be back to normal next week. At the moment, it’s looking like it’ll be about Tail Concerto for the PS1 but as always, it may change before then.
