## Paragraphs

Any line of text with a space above and below becomes a paragraph.

These two lines don't have a space
so they are merged together.

These two lines are not merged together<br>
because they contain an explicit line break.

This is a large amount of text that will render as a paragraph and despite what you might imagine will happen, there will be no magical line breaks or anything else that will save you from this extremely long run-off sentence so your only hope is that I will run out of text to type.
