I'm definitely not good at practicing this but while reading [Show Stopper!: The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft](https://www.amazon.com/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Generation-Microsoft/dp/0029356717), I noted that [Dave Cutler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Cutler) was big on always taking holidays on time.

I even tried to email him once to ask why but unfortunately I had no luck.
