Originally created as a project for learning, pkgparse is a hobby project that I still find useful to this day.

It's a CLI that provides information about various [NPM](https://npmjs.com) package such what they do and what are their 1st level dependendencies. It's fairly simplistic but I still find it quicker than a Google search on those rare occasions.

I've recently started working on a successor of sorts, which currently exists in the form of a [python api](https://github.com/marcus-crane/pkgparse) and an alpha [golang cli](https://github.com/marcus-crane/pkgpal). The intention is to basically recreate the original Node version but with support for multiple languages/registries.
