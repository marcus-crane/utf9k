![A screenshot of the towing.utf9k.net website. A map of the city of Auckland, New Zealand is visible with lots of little orange streaks visible on the map. Each streak represents a vehicle that was towed over a 3 year period. Each streak is in motion, heading to where they were towed to.](website.png)
