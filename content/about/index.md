# Hey there

This is my personal site.

I never write as much as I wish I would but there's a handful of articles you can read.

I'm currently work at [Xero](), a cloud accounting software company.

In particular, I'm a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) based out of our office in [Auckland, New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland).

You can find me on the web in a bunch of places:
