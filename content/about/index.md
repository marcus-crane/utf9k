I never write as much as I wish I would but there's a handful of articles you can read.

I currently work at [Mercedes-Benz New Zealand](https://www.mercedes-benz.co.nz/). I think we make cars or something.

In particular, I'm a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) based out of our office in [Newmarket, New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmarket,_New_Zealand).
