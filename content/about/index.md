I never write as much as I wish I would but there's a handful of articles you can read.

I'm currently work at [Xero](https://xero.com/nz/), a cloud accounting software company.

In particular, I'm a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) based out of our office in [Auckland, New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland).

My resume is hosted on this site [right here](/resume.pdf) if you want a better idea of the sort of stuff I've worked on.

You can find me on the web in a bunch of places:

* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/sentryism)

Finally, there's always trusty old email which is my first name @ this domain.
