I never write as much as I wish I would but there's a handful of articles you can read.

I'm currently work at [[https://www.xero.com/nz/][Xero]], a cloud-based accounting software company.

In particular, I'm a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering][Site Reliability Engineer]] based out of our office in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland][Auckland, New Zealand]].

My resume is hosted on this site [[/resume.pdf][resume]] if you want a better idea of the sort of stuff I've worked on.

You can find me on the web in a bunch of places:

- [[https://github.com/marcus-crane][Github]]
- [[https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=spondyl][Hacker News]]
- [[https://instagram.com/sentryism][Instagram]]
- [[https://linkedin.com/in/marcus-crane][LinkedIn]]
- [[https://lobste.rs/u/sentry][Lobsters]]
- [[https://steamcommunity.com/id/sandtree/][Steam]]
- [[https://twitter.com/sentreh][Twitter]]

Finally, there's always trusty old email which is my first name @ this domain.
