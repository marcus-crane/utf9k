I never write as much as I wish I would but there's a handful of articles you can read.

I currently work at [Xero](https://xero.com/nz/), a cloud accounting software company.

In particular, I'm a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site%5FReliability%5FEngineering) based out of our office in [Auckland, New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland).

My resume is hosted [here](/resume.pdf) if you want a better idea of what I've worked on before.

You can find me on the web in a bunch of places:

Finally, there's always trusty old email which is my first name @ this domain.
