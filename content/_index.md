Hey there

I'm [Marcus Crane](/about), and this is my personal site

A lot of things are being moved around at the moment but you can still read my content

If you're wondering where to find me about the web, check my [about](/about) page

Blog posts live [here](/blog) and I've started uploading various notes [here](/notes)

The notes are a bit of a mess though so don't expect to gain too much from them

This site is currently powered by `org-mode` so if you're interested, the source code lives [here](https://github.com/marcus-crane/utf9k)

Lastly, I've got a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page that you can find [here](/now)
