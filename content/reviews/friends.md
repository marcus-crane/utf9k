Videogame perfection. Move over Dork Souls because we have a new contender for
world's hardest game. Take all of the most minute, irrelevant details from
across 236 episodes of Friends, compact it all into a single trivia game and
the result is Friends: The One With All The Trivia.  
  
This game does not hold your hand. The second you hit Start, sit back because
you're about to endure a barrage of over 3000 questions and 700 video clips.
Your hosts Janice, Gunther and Jack & Judy Geller accompany you on the tour
letting out small jeers when you inevitably mess up. As someone who has never
seen an episode of Friends, it felt like a trip into hell itself.  
  
Once you choose a mode, which are essentially all the same I might add, then
get ready to stare at the same boring apartment building. I can only assume
it's where the cast of the show live but I have absolutely no idea. As you'd
expect, the gameplay is very basic. Questions appear on screen, accompanied by
a host of annoying voice overs.  
  
Each possible answer is mapped to a button but in true programming mastery, no
one thought it'd be a good idea to arrange the answers into a diamond shape to
match the face buttons. I guess the developers just thought it'd be too
forgiving to let the player quickly understand what button does what at a
glance.  
  
The true torture is in the little progress bar at the bottom of the screen. If
you answer correctly, one slot lights up. If you're wrong, a point is
subtracted, assuming you even managed to get one in the first place. I can't
stress hard enough that this game does not end until you have achieved 5
answers right in a row. It won't let you leave. In fact, as I write this, it's
been about 6 weeks and I'm still trapped playing this shitty game.  
  
Still itching to get that Friends fix? Try checking out the [official
website](http://friendstriviagame.warnerbros.com/index.php) for the game. You
can test your knowledge on each daily question. Yes, it's still updated daily
despite the game having released 10 years ago.
