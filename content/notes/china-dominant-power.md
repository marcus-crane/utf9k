Assumed that China will become the dominant military

Historically, the rise and fall of an economic superpower maps to the rise and fall of military power

In regards to growing an economy, there are a few inputs you can change:

1. Adding labour inputs

Adjunct Associate Professor John Lee believes that China can't add more labour inputs due to its demographics as there is a primarily older population

The number of working citizens will only decline as time goes on

More people are leaving the workforce than entering as at 2015

USA includes the only favourable demographics up to 2050

2. Adding capital inputs

By mid-90s, entrepreneurship was dead and mass exporting became the main source of income

Prior to the Global Financial Crisis, the major driver of growth was net exports

Surplus labour enabled them to scale up exporting to a never before seen level

3. Using inputs more productively

Due to the GFC, exports seized up and China was reliant on them as their source of growth

2004 - 2014 saw the Chinese economy expand 162% but 134% were due to capital inputs, primarily in fixed invest so ie; building and construction

National corporate debt grew 147% of GDP at the end of 2008 up to 250% at the end of 2014

9 - 10 trillion -> 20 - 25 trillion which is more debt than the size of the entire american commercial banking system

Government policy, not natural demand is what caused such an explosion in "growth"

Massive economic waste and abandoned infrastructure

4 biggest cities have unoccupied dwelling to house 200 million people

In short, they can't stimulate their economy effectively at all as it requires too much capital input to stimulate any output

Given the state / CCP controls most enterprise, they can control the distribution of jobs to the citizens and therefore keep "elites" on their side
