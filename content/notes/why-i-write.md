George Orwell's essay on why he writes, although in reality, the book was a collection of essays around the same idea.

As a result, you get to hear some of his views on various topics, spanning across a 15 year period.

## His reasons for writing

I was somewhat surprised but it seems that George initially, didn't write as much as you might think

> Nevertheless the volume of serious – i.e. seriously intended – writing which I produced all through my childhood and boyhood would not amount to half a dozen pagesNevertheless the volume of serious – i.e. seriously intended – writing which I produced all through my childhood and boyhood would not amount to half a dozen pages

As he got older, and visited various countries, he definitely started learning into the political works he was later known for.

He was, as one would have to be, fully aware of this as well.

> Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism, as I understand it.

While that might seem heavily biased, and it was, his thoughts were such

> And the more one is conscious of one’s political bias, the more chance one has of acting politically without sacrificing one’s aesthetic and intellectual integrity

## The power of illusion

In one of his essays, he talks about complacency towards the idea of democracy, which feels awfully familiar

> An illusion can become a half-truth, a mask can alter the expression of a face. The familiar arguments to the effect that democracy is ‘just the same as’ or ‘just as bad as’ totalitarianism never take account of this fact.

He doesn't pretend that the system isn't perfect however even the belief in it can have great effect

> All such arguments boil down to saying that half a loaf is the same as no bread. In England such concepts as justice, liberty and objective truth are still believed in. They may be illusions, but they are very powerful illusions. The belief in them influences conduct, national life is different because of them.

## The ignorance of authority

He further goes on to talk about how those in power, perhaps those strongly patriotic to the point of xenophobia, are likely unaware of their actions

> The left-wing writers who denounce the whole of the ruling class as ‘pro-Fascist’ are grossly over-simplifying. Even among the inner clique of politicians who brought us to our present pass, it is doubtful whether there were any conscious traitors. The corruption that happens in England is seldom of that kind

If communism was the answer, and was understood, surely those in power would think it sounds quite appealing

> The policeman who arrests the ‘red’ does not understand the theories the ‘red’ is preaching; if he did his own position as bodyguard of the moneyed class might seem less pleasant to him

Unfortunately, wealth doesn't have much to fear from fascism and its tendencies

> It is a fact that any rich man, unless he is a Jew, has less to fear from Fascism than from either Communism or democratic Socialism
