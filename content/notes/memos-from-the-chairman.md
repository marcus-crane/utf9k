This book is a bit of an odd one, containing a variety of memos from [Alan C. Greenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_C._Greenberg)

I just... realised that this entire time I had misread and thought this was in fact a book from [Alan Greenspan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan) 🤦

Anyway, while a borderline absurd at times, there were some useful bits and pieces to be found.

## Always keep an eye on expenses

> The year was over last Friday and it was a good one, but last year is gone. The score right now is nothing to nothing. Nobody cares (especially our competition) what we did last year

One thing that Alan hammered home continuously through his memos is that no one should get complacent just because they had a performant yet.

As is often the case, expendature would creep during boom times and no one would notice pennies falling down the cracks, figuratively speaking

> When things are good, you should be even more careful of expenses because it is ridiculous to leave anything on the table when you hold a royal flush. We must continue to be alert, aggressive and never complacent.

Perhaps his most famous memo is concerning paperclips

> When mortals go through a prosperous period, it seems to be human nature for expenses to balloon. We are going to be the exception. I have just informed the purchasing department that they should no longer purchase paper clips. All of us receive documents every day with paper clips on them. If we save these paper clips, not only will we have enough for our own use, but we will also, in a short time, be awash in the little critters

To my knowledge, this was quite literal despite how absurd it sounds at first. The guy was really big on saving for a rainy day.

## The best and brightest

This portion of a memo is quite interesting

> Every department should be staffed with the best and the brightest because I cannot tell you which area of our business will be “hot” six months from now.

I don't know really anything about the operating environment at Bear Stearns but the implication is that the CEO here is not to be seen as the be all and end all, which sounds obvious yet top down micro management is still a thing.

> This article made me realize how stupid I am because I did not know there was any other way to run a business but to make people accountable, make timely decisions and service the client.

Alan really liked to hammer home the same ideas over and over, and to generally just keep it simple, at least as far as far as taking his writing at face value. We are talking about Wall Street here after all

## In closing

> You cannot fly with the eagles and poop like a canary.

I can't really add anything to that
