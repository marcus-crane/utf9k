Metaphors are an important tool for any developer.

If you understand a topic poorly, you can greatly improve your understanding to something that you are more familiar with

A mental model in itself, can blind a person into making assumption, or guide them into making new discoveries.

For example, if your mental model was such that you believed the sun orbited the earth, you would perhaps have no reason to look for life outside the universe.

It wouldn't perhaps make sense if such a powerful entity as the sun were relegated to orbiting our small planet.

## Chapter 2: Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Development

Metaphors in software don't tell you where to find an answer, but rather how to look for one.

They are more akin to a heuristic than an algorithm.

A heuristic is a technique to teach yourself, while an algorithm is an express set of instructions.

A heuristic is indirect while a algorithm is direct

Let's use cooking an example:

Algorithm: Cook fish for 12 minutes at a high temperature (the second to last notch on the stove approximately)
Heuristic: Cook fish until it starts to turn brown. If you're unsure if it's ready, ask a flatmate for advice.

A heuristic still has a discovery phase associated with it, and requires the user to use their own instincts

Given the nature of programming, being very vague at times, we often have to rely on heuristics rather than algorithms for solving issues
