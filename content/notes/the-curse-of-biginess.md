A fascinating book from [Tim Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Wu) about the troubles of massive corporations

## Individual quality of life

> [Brandeis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Brandeis) discovered a stronger faith in decentralized systems, in the organic growth of business, and, for want of a better word, in “smallness.” He prized, indeed lionized, the human scale that had been the trademark of business and farming in America

As a little bit of context, J. P. Morgan were looking to consolidate all of the competition in New England by merging them into the [New Haven Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York,_New_Haven_and_Hartford_Railroad).

Brandeis took up the case to oppose this monopoly and in time, the mergers fell apart due to antitrust suits filed by the US Department of Justice

As a result, he came to believe in the power of "smallness" better serving both the employee and the customer.

> A worthy nation was one that served as cauldron for character and self-development, one that “compels us to strive for the development of the individual.”

Essentially what it says on the tin

> In order to live men must have the opportunity of developing their faculties; and they must live under conditions in which their faculties may develop naturally and healthily.

The implication here being that if workers don't have the economic security to exist outside of work itself, they will be impared when it comes to being a well rounded person.

> As he once wrote of the oppressive conditions and long hours at the new industrial firms, they threatened to create “a life so inhuman as to make our former Negro slavery infinitely preferable.”

I'm not sure who "he" is referring to but they were of the belief that Victorian Era industrial work was so inhumane so as to be worse than slavery.

Presumably the implication is that such cruelty is less likely to occur at smaller scales

## Dis-economies of scale

Sometimes big isn't always better

> First, at some point, economies of scale “run out”—that is, increasing size no longer creates further efficiencies. A car plant needs to be a certain size to be efficient, but after that, it no longer becomes any more efficient

There is believed to be an inflection point where size in itself becomes a liability

> The advantages, if any, are those related to size, power, reputation, and so on — compare the Domino’s chain to the local pizzeria — but are not actually related to the ability to make a better product

This has been proven time and time again that the prerequisites for a great product aren't specifically restricted to those who have major resources

In fact, often times, a lack of resources encourages some very competitive yet compelling solutions

> One is that as the size of the operation increases, “dis-economies” of scale begin to creep in, as economists since Alfred Marshall in the 1920s have suggested. For example, as a firm adds more and more employees, it needs to add more managers, and ever-more complex systems of internal control.

While an unfortunate reality, I'd never heard the term "dis-economies of scale" before. It makes sense as a term though.

> In other words, a firm may not actually become more efficient as it gets larger, but may become better at raising prices or keeping out competitors.

There are plenty of large corporations floating around that seems to offer very little in the way of new value and instead just keep milking their previous hits past the point of death

> For that reason, oversized, inefficient firms can persist for decades, effectively immunized from the need to improve products or lower prices. Instead, like American domestic airlines, the industry can happily offer a product that continues to get worse and cost more.

At no point, does this scale benefit the consumer, which is usually the defence throw up against even the slightest whiff of an antitrust case.

"But prices will rise if we are broken us" is often the claim.

Bah, good riddance! I'd rather pay a little more for a better product personally. Cheap is expensive as the saying goes.
