:toc: preamble

Compulsory ujamaa villages in Tanzania, collectivisation in Russia, Le Corbusierâ€™s urban planning theory realised in Brasilia, the Great Leap Forward in China, agricultural "modernisation" in the Tropicsâ€”the twentieth century has been racked by grand utopian schemes that have inadvertently brought death and disruption to millions. Why do well-intentioned plans for improving the human condition go tragically awry?

== Terms to look up

* [ ] Brasilia
* [ ] Chandigarh

== Ideas

* A state is unable to focus on one single "customer", rather building with all views in mind.

* We have our own personal filters which mean we sometimes only see the positive or negative aspects of a situation.

* Negativity is good in the sense that it is usually actionable and specific.

* A state assumes that each individual can be assigned an address which makes remote working difficult.
