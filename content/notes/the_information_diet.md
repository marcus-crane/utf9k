> Few could afford to be fat, and thus being so was often considered a way to display one’s prosperity

> Letter on Corpulence was written by a suffering person, for suffering people. His message resonated. People were ready to hear it. And Banting provided it in a form they could understand.

Letter on Corpulence, written by William Banting, was considered one of the first calls to diet. In reality, the notion of a diet wasn't new at all!

What made it stand out though, was that it was written by someone who was no stranger to the problems that come with a lack of diet. That, and it was written in a way that the average person was able to simply grasp. No fancy doctors words that made your brain hurt.

> Calendars appear to have been developed about 10,000 years ago, improving our ability to plant seasonal crops.

Interesting to know

> There were some who believed, during the development of the railway, that a woman’s uterus could go flying out of her body if she accelerated to 50 miles per hour

> Blaming a medium or its creators for changing our minds and habits is like blaming food for making us fat

> Should corporations building personalization algorithms include mutations to break a reader’s filter bubble?

It's easy to blame Mark Zuckerberg, and he should be held accountable, but it is true that ultimately consumers have to show some personal restraint.

The reality is, that there's little regulation on who can participate in these ecosystems, making it hard to control exposure to those who don't know what they're getting caught up in

> It’s not the total amount of information, but your information habit that is pushing you to whatever extreme you find uncomfortable

> Information overconsumption means we need to find new ways to be selective about our intake. It is very difficult, for example, to overconsume vegetables

Drives home that media and information should be treated as an intake that can make you ill, just like physical and mental health

> CNN sits at the bottom in the middle, providing real news that nobody wants to hear.

> In the world of fiduciary responsibility, quality journalism means market inefficiency

> There’s no money in shaking the crown of power from a lowly perch. There is money in feeding novel info to a ravenous, neophilic audience

Sadly true

> When he wrote his Letter on Corpulence, the Calorie was a unit used to measure the energy consumption of steam engines

> ... the liberal brains had structural differences in the anterior cingulate cortex—the region of the brain responsible for empathy and conflict monitoring. Conservative brain structures, by contrast, had enlarged right amygdali—the part of the brain responsible for picking up threatening facial expressions and responding to threatening situations aggressively

Seems a bit heretical but I could believe it. It's later stated that this was mostly a standalone study so it would need to be replicated many times over to be proven accurate

> For thousands of years, those that sought information got to live longer, got to have sex, and pass on their genes

Somewhat ironic that perhaps a deluge of information being readily available is arguably correlating with a decline in sexual activity

> He defines agnotology as the study of culturally induced doubt, particularly through the production of seemingly factual data. It’s a modern form of manufactured ignorance.

> just accept your own ignorance as the only thing to be certain about

> the emWave2 and the StressEraser

These are heartrate monitoring devices I believe

> Holding your breath has some serious consequences; not only does it regulate the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood, but it also helps regulate your fight/flight response

> They stipulate that laughter itself is a social signal that demonstrates cognitive prowess—something that’s useful in mate selection—and thus, our ability to laugh spread through generations

>  If you can’t laugh at something, it likely means you’re not flexible with the information

> Create a group, list, or circle for family members, another for close friends, another for work colleagues, and another for people you’d like to get to know better, and read those posts consciously during set periods of the day
