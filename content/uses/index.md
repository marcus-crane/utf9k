For the unaware, this is inspired by the [/uses](https://uses.tech) page idea

## Text Editor

I flip flop a lot in this area.

For quick edits, including this page, I pop out [nvim](https://neovim.io) although I'm not proficient enough to know many of the keyboard shortcuts.

For larger projects, I've been trying out [Nova](https://www.nova.app) recently in place of [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)

For [Go](https://golang.org) projects, I prefer to use JetBrain's [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) IDE.

For [Python](https://python.org) projects, I occasionally use JetBrain's [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) IDE but not as much as I could.

Earlier last year, I used [Emacs](https://gnu.org/software/emacs) for a bit, specifically [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs), and I'd like to get back there.

If I can figure out how to get [LSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol) working nicely, and on the same level as say; PyCharm or GoLand, then I'd happily make the jump.

I just haven't simply invested in it is all.

## Terminal

Currently, I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) with [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) Italic 12 and the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/iterm/) colour scheme.

Everything else is stock and unconfigured.
