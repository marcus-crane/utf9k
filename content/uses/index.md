## Development tools

### Editor

[Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) is my current [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) distribution of choice.

I use `evil-mode` which means Emacs is controlled with `vim` keybindings.

Whenever I don't feel like using Emacs, or don't have it installed, I usually reach for [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), [neovim](https://neovim.io) or even [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/)

I have no issue with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and it's a great tool but there's generally nothing I can't already do in a different editor so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Hardware

### Home

#### Desktop

A decently powerful custom built desktop running [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/). It's a really nice Linux distribution, based on Ubuntu, and I highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking for something new.

#### Laptop

I generally use a [MacBook Pro 13-inch (2015)](https://support.apple.com/kb/sp715?locale=en_NZ) for any personal projects and general browsing.

#### Phone

I swear I have ADHD when it comes to phones.

Currently, I'm using a [Samsung Galaxy S20](https://www.samsung.com/nz/smartphones/galaxy-s20/buy/) running [Android 10](https://www.android.com/android-10/) and [Niagara Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&hl=en)

It's actually pretty nice considering Samsung UX can often be a little hit or miss.

### Work

#### Laptop

Currently I'm using a [MacBook Pro 13-inch (2019)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP795?locale=en_NZ) as my daily driver for work.

It's a placeholder while I wait for my intended laptop to arrive from overseas. I think it's a 2020 Macbook Pro but no idea what kind of configuration.

#### Phone

For my work phone, I'm using an [iPhone SE (2020)](https://www.apple.com/nz/iphone-se/)

It's under its own apple account as is the laptop above to save my work tabs mixing up with my home tabs

## Software

### Shell

Often I switch around a bit but I'm currently running stock [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)

Stock in the sense that I'm not running Oh My Zsh! but rather just a small [handwritten configuration file](https://github.com/marcus-crane/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/zshrc.org).

I'm not running anything fancy as far as terminals: stock macOS terminal and whatever ships with Pop!\_OS by default.
