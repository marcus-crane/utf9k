A list of things I've still got left to do for the "revamp" of my site

Progress through this list: <progress id="todo" value="1" max="24"></progress>

* [ ] ADD ARIA ACCESSIBILITY TAGS TO EVERYTHING
* [ ] Review links since I know some are broken but don't remember where
* [ ] Investigate if a link checker is possible
* [ ] Add an identifier for links that knowing 404 but are shared for historical purposes
* [ ] Fiddle around with CSS drop caps
* [ ] Add ability for users to customise the text formatting a little bit
* [ ] Add support for inline footnotes (I believe Hugo added this in a recent version)
* [x] Mobile responsiveness (good enough for now)
* [ ] Convert blog posts into page bundles
* [ ] Create a side projects page for showing stuff I've worked on
* [ ] Update `manifest.json` colour scheme
* [ ] Consider `scss` over plain CSS
* [ ] Add some more "pizzaz" such as link hovers and that
* [ ] Surface table source for download (I swear I did this already... maybe it was in a different branch)
* [ ] Surface table names
* [ ] Surface code block names + types
* [ ] Double check that files all end with a newline
* [ ] Double check that I haven't mixed up tabs and spaces. Why is this still a thing
* [ ] Refresh layout for contact page
* [ ] Use CSS grid for mobile layout
* [ ] Update README to reflect current build
* [ ] Figure out how to edit tags overview without breaking the tag lists themselves (ie modify /tags/ but not /tags/linux/)
* [ ] Can I disable list items when using markdown checklists?
* [ ] Is the font too big? I should ask some people. I feel like it might be too big...
