A list of things I've still got left to do for the "revamp" of my site

* [ ] Review links since I know some are broken but don't remember where
* [ ] Investigate if a link checker is possible
* [ ] Add an identifier for links that knowing 404 but are shared for historical purposes
* [ ] Fiddle around with CSS drop caps
* [ ] Add ability for users to customise the text formatting a little bit
* [ ] Add support for inline footnotes
  * I believe Hugo added this in a recent version
* [ ] Mobile responsiveness
* [ ] Convert blog posts into page bundles
* [ ] Create a side projects page for showing stuff I've worked on
* [ ] Update `manifest.json` colour scheme
* [ ] Consider `scss` over plain CSS
* [ ] Add some more "pizzaz" such as link hovers and that
* [ ] Surface table source for download
* [ ] Surface table names
* [ ] Surface code block names + types
