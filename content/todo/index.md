A list of things I've still got left to do for the "revamp" of my site

Progress through this list: <progress id="todo" value="12" max="28"></progress>

* [x] ADD ARIA ACCESSIBILITY TAGS TO EVERYTHING (allegedly)
	* Review Markdown image links as they should support descriptions that I know aren't filled in
* [ ] Review links since I know some are broken but don't remember where
  * [x] Internal
  * [ ] External
* [x] Investigate if a link checker is possible
* [x] Add an identifier for links that knowing 404 but are shared for historical purposes
	* Can just use footnotes for this given how littlefoot looks
* [ ] Fiddle around with CSS drop caps
	* Might be reserved for certain articles or it just looks ugly
* [ ] Add ability for users to customise the text formatting a little bit
* [x] Add support for inline footnotes (I believe Hugo added this in a recent version)
* [x] Mobile responsiveness (good enough for now)
* [x] Convert blog posts into page bundles
* [ ] Create a side projects page for showing stuff I've worked on
* [ ] Update `manifest.json` colour scheme
	* Maybe not, it's a nice colour
* [ ] Consider `scss` over plain CSS
* [ ] Add some more "pizzaz" such as link hovers and that
	* Anchor links to headings
	* Link hovers
* [ ] Surface table source for download (I swear I did this already... maybe it was in a different branch)
* [ ] Surface table names
* [ ] Surface code block names + types
* [x] Double check that files all end with a newline
* [x] Double check that I haven't mixed up tabs and spaces. Why is this still a thing
* [x] Refresh layout for contact page
* [x] Use CSS grid for mobile layout
* [ ] Update README to reflect current build
* [ ] Figure out how to edit tags overview without breaking the tag lists themselves (ie modify /tags/ but not /tags/linux/)
* [x] Can I disable list items when using markdown checklists?
* [ ] Is the font too big? I should ask some people. I feel like it might be too big...
* [ ] Add a proper navigation for mobile (perhaps in general too)
* [ ] Consider adding a footer
