{{% notice title="Please excuse the mess!" %}}
I've just rolled out a decently sizable rewrite of my site so some things may still be a little messy.

The bulk of it has rolled out but in an attempt to get the bulk of it out the door, I've decided to eject a little early.

Realistically, I think it should be perfectly fine but if you do notice anything a little wonky, feel free to reach out to me at [wonkiness@utf9k.net](mailto:wonkiness@utf9k.net?subject=I%20noticed%20something%20a%20little%20off)

For those interested, I'm maintaining a list so I don't forget [here](/todo/)
{{% /notice %}}

My name is [Marcus Crane](/about) and you're currently logged on to my personal website.

I maintain a [blog](/blog) and also keep a running lists of [questions](/questions) regarding topics I often want to remember things about for later.

If you want to know what I'm up to, or realistically what I was up to like two weeks ago, there's a [page](/now) for that.

Finally, if you have any questions or just want to drop a comment, you can pick your poison over on my [contact](/contact) page.
