For the unaware, this is inspired by the [/uses](https://uses.tech) page idea

## Text Editor

I flip flop a lot in this area.

For most things, I reach for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which I mostly have not set up properly.

I aspire to get back to using [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) now that I have discovered the much improved [emacs-mac](https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/src) distribution.

For Golang projects of a much larger size, I often reach for [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/)

When I need to view extremely large files or I just want to do a quick edit, I'll often reach for [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) although it's just using the stock configuration.

## Terminal

Currently, I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) with [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/) Regular 14 and the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/iterm/) colour scheme.

Everything else is stock and unconfigured.
