Often times, I come across a rare gem on Twitter, such as long tweet storms

That's great but there's usually a load of trudging through pure crap

I wonder if those insights are worth sticking out for compared to using the noise bearing time more effectively

Similarly, if a long-winded idea is being shared on eg; Twitter, will an ineffective medium being chosen hinder the message trying to be conveyed?
