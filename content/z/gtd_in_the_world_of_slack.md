-   There isn't a consensus on whether the tool should be used asyncronously or syncronously
-   It can be tempting to be pulled into a thread in real time because otherwise it'll get buried in the river of noise
-   Tendency for late additions to a thread to not hold as much weigh, unless it's a summarising message from someone with authority
-   Feels like a lot of messaging is reactionary to things rather than considered due to the medium
-   Probably needs to be an emphasis on long form
-   No insight or feedback into the distraction caused by `@here`, `@channel` or `@team` type of notifications
