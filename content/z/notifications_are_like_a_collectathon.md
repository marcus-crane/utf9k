I think that the relief that comes from excessively clearing notifications is basically the same behaviour that drives people to enjoy [Collectathons](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectAThonPlatformer)

Basically the driving side of [Notification Alcoholism]({{< relref "notification_alcoholism" >}})

Perhaps that suggests clearing out notifications is a form of relief that I would compare to "escaping quicksand"
