## Stuck in bed

I recently, foolishly, acquired a massive sunburn on my right foot.

It's to the extent that I can't really walk so I end up requiring crutches.

Thankfully I can work from home, and I have been for the past week.

## Emacs

I don't really use Emacs much these days, as I found it became a bit too much high friction.

I've been porting my site back to using Markdown, given its universality.

That's not to say I don't greatly appreciate the power of `org` of course!

## Reading

I'm slowly reading through [In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives](https://www.amazon.com/Plex-Google-Thinks-Works-Shapes/dp/1416596585) which is a pretty fascinating insight to the early days of Google.

I really expected it'd be just obvious stuff that's already known but Steven Levy really was in the trenches, floating around the office and seeing the behemoth as it was built one line at a time.

He doesn't glorify Larry, Sergei and Eric either thankfully as I expected the author might feel obliged to, given the amount of access.

One thing about Google is the willingness to constantly shut down services that they're "institutionally bored" with and I feel like I got that sense of culture to a certain extent.
