## Lockdown

Here in [Auckland, New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland), we've been in lockdown since Tuesday 17th August 2021.

Currently, we are at [Alert Level 3](https://covid19.govt.nz/alert-levels-and-updates/about-the-alert-system/#alert-level-3-%E2%80%94-restrict) although we're being phased out in [3 steps](https://covid19.govt.nz/alert-levels-and-updates/regional-advice/auckland/).

Admittely, this second level of tiered restrictions has added complexity that wasn't required but it's mainly to ease the itchiness that Aucklanders started having after being at Level 4 for about 5 weeks.

Currently we can meet one other household (at a time) outside to socialise which is an improvement over no interaction with other bubbles.

## Holiday period

I'm about to start a new position as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer with [Vend by Lightspeed](https://www.vendhq.com/nz/) but before then, I've got about 10 days in between where I'm technically unemployed.

August 19th was by birthday so I was going to take some time off but instead I spent it in Level 4 lockdown and self isolating in my bedroom while I waited for a COVID test to come back.

It might be some time before I can travel as I intended to for my birthday but ah well.
