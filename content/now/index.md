## Trying not to enter a coma

I didn't have much time off during the holiday season, and the time that I did have felt like I mostly just slept or was trying not to sleep so I haven't felt "refreshed" in a while.

Speaking of refreshed

## Site refresh

As you'll have spotted from the large sign on the "front door", I finally got around to refreshing my site design.

I've had this on the back burner for a little while and while not complete, I finally managed to push out the bulk of something that I can continue to mould over time.

In hindsight, it feels like a remix of all of the various layouts I've had over time, including some old sites.

So far, I'm pretty happy with it but there's always more to do

## Computers

I fixed my computer troubles. It was something stupid of course.

## Videogames

I haven't actually played much for quite a while but I got back into [Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon_Story:_Cyber_Sleuth) over the holiday season.

I'm only on Chapter 9 but I've managed to grind my way to 2 [PlatinumNumemon](https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/PlatinumNumemon) equipped with a bunch of tactician USBs. Put simply, you can get a game breaking amount of EXP.

I also started playing through [Kingdom Hearts III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_III) properly. I won't spoil anything.
