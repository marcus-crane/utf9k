## 2023 is coming to an end

My last "now" update was all the way back in 2022!

Geez, time flies.

I hadn't written much this year, as I had some [personal hurdles](/blog/i-dont-identify-as-anxious) to jump over but I'm slowly getting back into having side projects and other things.

I finally got a post [off the backburner](/blog/spreadsheet-to-visualisation) recently and I might have some notes sitting around to cobble into another.

The live player widget on the homepage still makes me proud, mainly due to the infrastructure that powers it all, but I'd like to flesh it out even more which I'm slowly chipping away at.

Beyond that, I dunno, I started experimenting with [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) but it hasn't been enough time to really say much about it yet.
