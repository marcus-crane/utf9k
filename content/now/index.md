**Towing data**

I'm currently working on visualising some towing data, which has been on the backburner for some time.

The hardest part, taking a messy spreadsheet and turning it into machine-readable GeoJSON, is done thankfully.

Here's a little sneak peek:

**This site**

While I had decided to just pick a theme and use it, I'd be lying if I didn't think tinkering with styling is half of the fun.

It'll be something to refine over time but at least I can say it's all mine ðŸ˜ˆ

**Content**

I've mostly been adhoc about writing stuff but now that I've got a handful of posts, I'm going to try and set up a content calendar and actually get stuff out.

There's plenty of ideas I've had written down but now I'm actually trying to focus on this site and get some of those things made

**Running**

I'm not particularly good at it but as a new habit to pick up for February, I've taken up running as a... hobby? Do people class exercise as a hobby? Can you just say that?

Anyway, I'm slowly making progress which is a nice feeling but don't expect me to be any more specific than that.
