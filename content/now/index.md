## Lockdown

Here in [Auckland, New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland), we've been at [Alert Level 4](https://covid19.govt.nz/alert-levels-and-updates/about-the-alert-system/#alert-level-4-%E2%80%94-lockdown) since Tuesday 17th August 2021.

I remember the date because I happened to be at a location of interest and so I got a COVID-19 test just to make sure. I was fine but I did end up spending my 27th birthday in lockdown while I was awaiting my test results.

This marks my second birthday in a row that I've spent in lockdown, which I spent self-isolating in my bedroom away from my flatmates.

Ah well, it could have been much worse anyway. Good thing I had plenty of snacks!

At the time of writing, we're a few days from having been in lockdown for an entire month at the highest level!

## Job

I have some news to share on this front shortly but as someone overly cautious about these sorts of changes, I'm just waiting to get my references cleared before I officially announce some exciting news :)

## This site

I've been fiddling around with my site, slowly making improvements here and there given my spare time in lockdown.

The last major change has been the addition of the sidebar which shows all of the actual content on my site. Most of it has been hidden unintentionally so now you can see everything that's accessible for the most part.

I've still got more design changes I want to make but I've opted to slowly roll them out over time rather than doing one big bang.

Realistically, it's because I don't always have it in me to be productive on the computer!

## Videogames

I've been trying to play some more videogames lately, given that I've been pretty slack at sitting down and playing (which is perhaps ironically backwards?)

Anyway, I finished Yuito's route in Scarlet Nexus earlier today in addition to slowly working through Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies.

You can see how that's going in my recently backfilled [games](/games) page.
