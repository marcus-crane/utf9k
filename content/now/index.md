## Continuing with some decent habits

The last month or two has been [a little bumpy](/blog/let-your-streaks-end-naturally/) so I've been trying to make sure that I keep up with a reasonable routine.

Apparently I'm 41 days into using [Ten Percent Happier](https://www.tenpercent.com/) and the name is pretty accurate. It isn't my first run in with meditation but generally I tend to be skeptical about these sorts of things. Having said that, I'm definitely invested.

I had tried out Headspace and I didn't really get it? It felt like each day was just the same thing every time. In hindsight, that is the practice of course but the nice thing about Ten Percent is that they present a mix of video and audio.

The video portion is a sort of meta discussion around meditation while the audio is an actual guided session, sometimes related to the discussion that just occurred. I think that has definitely helped me "get it" more but of course, there's no end state or anything to win.

It's a bit expensive but the production quality and library is sizable so I ended up buying a yearly subscription. I can issue guest passes that let you try it for 30 days (no credit card required!) which is cool. If you'd like one, you can reach me via any of the contact methods at the bottom of this page, and to the right.

Beyond that, I've still been going to the gym every few days (over a year now!) so that's cool.

Looks cool but I still haven't gotten around to sitting down and figuring out how to integrate it into my tools.

## My site

I can feel myself getting itchy for a redesign again. The site text is too huge if you ask me and is mostly just the [tailwind typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) default settings rather than having its own unique flare. It's too generic!

Odds are that I'll end up going for a center column style again but I'd like to give the reader some "progressively enhanced" options to change text alignment and so on if they wish. I can feel the scope creep in my bones.

Beyond that, I've been pretty happy with the amount of content I've churned so far. There's still plenty more to go of course.

A handy trick seems to be "just working on a post for 5 minutes" and then the completionist part of your brain is like "No, it's not time to stop yet" and then hours go by.

This very update is the result of that principle!

## Videogames

Hah! What's a videogame?

I actually finished off [Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV:_Shadowbringers) recently. I'm now currently up to date as far as the main scenario goes and I'm all aboard the [Endwalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV:_Endwalker) hype train.

I purchased [Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_Rift_Apart) and it's downloading remotely but I'm not home at the time of writing so I've yet to crack it open. As someone who has played almost every Ratchet & Clank title[^1] since the Playstation 2 era, it's really nice to see the series is still going strong. I just wish I could say the same about [Jak and Daxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter) ðŸ˜”

While away from home, I have been getting back into [Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney_%E2%88%92_Trials_and_Tribulations) on Nintendo 3DS. I already played the original trilogy back on DS but I intended to replay the trilogy as a refresher for [Apollo Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Justice:_Ace_Attorney). I started that journey like 5 years ago now and the series has been ported multiple times... At this point, I'm so close that I can't give up (Near the end of Case 2) but it's been so long that I might as well just watch the anime for a re-refresher...

[^1]: I've finished almost every entry, often multiple times. I tried out [Into the Nexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_Into_the_Nexus), [All 4 One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_All_4_One) and [QForce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_Full_Frontal_Assault) but I never got too far into them. I don't think I ever played [Going Mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_Going_Mobile) or [Secret Agent Clank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Agent_Clank).
