Some time ago, I started reading a book called [Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More] by Alexei Yurchak. I read the two chapters or so while waiting in an airport once and it's quite tough going in some spots.

It's essentially about Soviet Russia and the sort of paradoxical feeling "in the air" described as being "Both a complete belief in the USSR and yet absolutely no surprise that it was about to fall apart".

Some of the ideas in it are easy to understand at face value but actually "getting them" and being able to understand the feeling of what is described is something I remember struggling with. Without a proper mental model of how someone might be viewing the world, it's hard to know how to play with the ideas and how they might shape your actions as a person.

There's one particular section I think about from time to time that talks about the various officials in the USSR and how they were effectively performing rituals without understanding or "participating". An example might be a committee, set up in the time of Stalin's communist era, that has been going past the point of its initial purpose. People are still performing the various acts of the ritual (meeting, discussing things) but without any understanding of where it fits or possibly even what consequences may come about from it.

I was actually reminded of it because I thought I had a glimmer of that feeling earlier today. For context, here in New Zealand, life is effectively normal. We still have some hotels that act as "quarantine" for incoming citizens and travellers but beyond that, you wouldn't know what year it was really.

One leftover of previous lockdowns is that masks are stil mandated on public transport. Well, mandated is perhaps a strong word to use. It's not up to the transport authority to necessarily enforce it but likewise, the New Zealand Police aren't sitting on trains and buses making sure that people wear them either. Generally, people just wear them because It's The Thing To Do.

To be clear, this isn't a discussion about the validity of face masks. I wear mine daily on public transport.

What I did oddly realise however is that the whole thing feels a bit ritualistic in the same sense as the USSR story I was struggling to understand. I'll give you an example.

When getting off of a train, the hundred or so people all take their masks of at the same time and then walk throughout the relatively busy train station. These, of course, are the exact same people that we just travelled an entire train trip nearby so logically, it makes sense to not take your mask off until you exit the station, away from other people.

In reality, it's because everyone has their own risk profiles (whether they know it or not) and the risk of either a) getting pulled up b) catching something or c) both, is greatly diminished when getting off the platform.

I'm sure plenty of people, myself included, put on their masks, wear them on public transport, and take them off often at the same intervals every time without realising. In that sense, it has become a ritual of sorts that we don't think about nor do we think about the consequences of taking it off too early.
