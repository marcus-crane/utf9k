As much as [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) is great on a technical level, the user experience keeps degrading all the time.

Installing it is a complete nightmare of clicking through super slow window transitions and banners begging you to upgrade your account.

Recently I went through the process of deleting my account (again) out of frustration only to find that the already lengthy process had gotten even longer!

Let's walk through the deletion process as it stands in April 2021 and see how many clicks it takes.

From your file view, you'll want to click on your avatar (**First click**)

From the dropbown, click on Settings (**Second click**)

  A screenshot of the Dropbox account settings. There are a variety of radio buttons and tabs but the main item of interest is a link at the bottom titled "Delete account".

Now that we're inside the Settings menu, click on Delete account (**Third click**)

That should be it... right? Done. Simple?

We're just getting started.

  A page asking the author if they would like to downgrade. It says that the author has to downgrade their account, that they'll lose a bunch of storage and lists some consequences such as "Dropbox will stop syncing". At the bottom are two buttons, one in blue that reads "I changed my mind, take me back to Dropbox" and one in white that reads "I still want to downgrade". The downgrade button is clearly what the user is after but the colour coding makes it tricky since the "I don't want to cancel" one is more prominent.

If we really have to, I can handle putting up with one of these pages but come on, the colour coding of these buttons is clearly a [dark pattern](https://www.darkpatterns.org/). I clearly clicked a button called "Delete account" and now the primary action on this page is "I changed my mind".

Additionally, the wording suggesting that I need to cancel my subscription is odd, in that deleting an account inherently is the same act as cancelling a subscription. Yes, I realise I'm not using a thing I paid for. I don't care.

So anyway, we resist the urge and click on "I still want to downgrade", which weirdly does not say "Complete downgrade". You know what this means... (**Fourth click**)

{{< image src="/blog/dropbox-is-way-too-clingy/04-second-screen.png" >}}
  A pop up modal asking if the author still wants to cancel. It has a bunch of radio buttons with reasons for cancellation, with the author having selected one that reads "I found another product I liked better". There is a button labelled "Skip" in the bottom left and two buttons on the bottom right. They read "Don't cancel" and "Continue cancelling". Strangely, "Continue cancelling" is the more prominent of the two, unlike the previous page.

God, yes! I'm two screens deep already, I'm pretty fucking sure I would like to cancel. I'm not "thinking" of leaving, I already decided that when you started degrading the UI instead of literally just doing nothing and continuing to make bank through word of mouth and technological advantages.

Hell, even just the lock-in from existing applications already does most of the convincing for me.

Interesting, the colour coding has switched once again to suggest that "Continue canceling" is now the primary action again. Is this to trick me into not cancelling? I also didn't notice that sneaky Skip option in the bottom left.

(**Fifth and sixth clicks**)

{{< image src="/blog/dropbox-is-way-too-clingy/05-third-screen.png" >}}
  Another page with the title "Dropbox Plus is so much more than just space" and presents some alleged reasons to stay like "Easy sharing" and "Large storage volume". These are the same bullet points, roughly, as the earlier page. At the bottom are two buttons, a prominent blue one on the left titled "Keep Dropbox Plus" and a transparent, less obvious one on the right titled "I still want to downgrade".
{{< /image >}}

How many fonts does Dropbox use? None of these screens are even consistent whatsoever.

I don't have a problem with the product, I have a problem with the marketing department so none of this is helping. If anything, it has the opposite effect of making me want to cancel even further.

The colour coding has changed yet again to suggest "Keep Dropbox Plus" is the primary action.

(**Seventh click**)

{{< image src="/blog/dropbox-is-way-too-clingy/06-final-screen.png" >}}
  Yet another page titled "Before you go, Marcus...", addressed to the author. It has a large blue button in the middle of the screen that reads "I changed my mind, take me back to Dropbox". There is another button for cancelling somewhere off screen that is not visible to the reader. The rest of the page just roughly lists the same claimed features as previous pages.
{{< /image >}}

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BEFORE I GO? THIS IS LITERALLY THE SAME INFORMATION PRESENTED FOR THE THIRD TIME. HOW IS THIS A CONVINCING ARGUMENT? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU AREN'T EVEN TRYING.

You can't even see the cancel button on this page. You have to scroll right to the bottom (which I didn't screenshot) and then click another cancel button.

(**Eighth click**)

  A tightly cropped screenshot of a green banner that reads "Account downgraded. Thanks for your feedback."
{{< /image >}}

Now originally, this is where I had ended the blog post but I actually went back to Dropbox months later and just discovered this process hadn't even deleted my account. All I accomplished was that I downgraded my plan?!

{{< image src="/blog/dropbox-is-way-too-clingy/08-banner.png" >}}

So, let's finish this thing off for real.

Back to the home page, we once again click on the user profile and then on Settings

(**Ninth and tenth clicks**)

Once more, hit the "Delete account" button at the bottom

(**Eleventh click**)

{{< image src="/blog/dropbox-is-way-too-clingy/07-done.png" >}}
  A form that says "Permanently delete your Dropbox account" with three inputs: one for your password, one for your reason for leaving and a third to enter in more details.
{{< /image >}}

Five more clicks to fill in this shitty form, not including typing a message and that brings us up to **Sixteen clicks**

Finally, **seventeen clicks** later, I'm free.

  A tightly cropped screenshot of a black banner that reads "Your account has been deleted. We're sorry to see you go."
{{< /image >}}

Why would I ever come back here? No company that did this sort of shit ever made me feel welcome back. To this day, I have never resubscribed to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com) purely because their cancellation policy requires you to ring a human person in New York.

Anyway, there's one really one thing I have to say to Dropbox after all this:
