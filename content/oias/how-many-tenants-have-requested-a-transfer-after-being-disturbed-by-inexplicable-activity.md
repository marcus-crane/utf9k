This person wanted to know how many Kainga Ora (Housing New Zealand) tenants have been relocated or filed complaints in regards to houses being "haunted" over a five year period.

They were unable to perform a free-text search as each office houses different files so there is seemingly no centralised way to query all case files.

As a result, we don't definitively know that there have never been any transfers due to hauntings.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that the requestor would go on to become slightly [infamous](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/rnz-scandal-more-changes-to-reuters-content-found-with-palestine-china-north-korea-stories-also-edited/EPZEPOYKYRHVTDKTVBYCVA72ZA/).
