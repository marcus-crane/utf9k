There is a gaming community called Beehive Roleplay who roleplay as emergency services using FiveM, a multiplayer mod for Grand Theft Auto V running on dedicated servers.

In order to have their simulation be as accurate as possible, in-game vehicles are branded with real-life branding such as those used by Fire and Emergency NZ (FENZ).

At the time of the request, it seems that while FENZ had asked Beehive RP whether they had permission, a lot of it was still covered by legal privilege as to whether a cease and desist was filed.
