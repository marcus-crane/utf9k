The actual request itself was not something I had ever considered, and the answer is zero deaths.

However, what was interesting was the mention of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems.

I had never heard of it before but it's essentially an index of all the different categories of death which each have a code assigned to them.
