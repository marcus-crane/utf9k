A spreadsheet containing deployability percentages of [NZDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Defence_Force) personnel.

I'd never really thought about it before now and probably would have found it believable that almost 100% of personnel would be deployable?

It doesn't really break down what particular role each member has, which is probably a factor.

I also wonder what differs between domestic and international deployability.
