This request is interesting, not so much for the content of the request itself but because the typesetting in the [attached slide deck](https://fyi.org.nz/request/20603/response/78529/attach/5/OIA2223%200239%20J%20Bruning%20Documents.pdf) seems to break down as it progresses.

See Page 71 as an example.
