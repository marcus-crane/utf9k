This was a request about Apple Carplay and Android Auto allegedly cutting out in the Tamaki Drive area, as well as some other locations.

Radio Spectrum Management (RSM) had a look and weren't able to replicate the issue at all.

They did also note that WiFi and Bluetooth call under a General User Radio License (GURL) so there has to be repeated reports for any given incident to cross the threshold for investigating.

While the only claim about this issue is a single Reddit thread, and groups have known to mass-hallucinate events, it is an interesting story regardless.

Personally I don't own a car so I wouldn't have any way of trying to replicate these issues but it does bring to mind a couple of cases where I've had Bluetooth earbuds glitch out, usually around the same areas.

I had always put it down to a density issue so perhaps there could be heavier equipment at place.

One Redditor claimed that CCTV backhaul and NZTA/AT traffic monitoring has been identified as being at play but didn't provide any evidence of those claims.
