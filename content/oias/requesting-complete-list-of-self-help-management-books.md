Prime Minster Christopher Luxon sat down in a [2024 joint interview](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/pm-christopher-luxon-and-finance-minister-nicola-willis-joint-interview-how-they-operate-and-a-budget-of-surprises-and-bold-moves/DXHNGF4LYNEPZGAZWQ3UOMMCKE/) with Finance Minister Nicola Willis and the New Zealand Herald.

Nicola mentioned that Chris Luxon had assigned a list of "self-help management books" to public department heads but that she had not personally read them.

This request uncovered the names of those books which were Good to Great, The First 90 Days and The Five Dysfunctions of a Team.
