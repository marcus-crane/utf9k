This request was filed via Instagram and received some coverage from [Newsroom](https://newsroom.co.nz/2024/06/18/40-year-old-official-information-laws-fare-well-on-social-media).

While social media isn't the most ideal avenue for filing an OIA, it is still a valid one.

The Ombudsman once [issued a ruling](https://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/sites/default/files/2022-02/Request%20made%20via%20Twitter.pdf) that a tweet is a valid medium for request.
