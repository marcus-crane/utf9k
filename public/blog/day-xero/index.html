  <div id="content"><p>Technically it&rsquo;s Day 1 of my new job, a Graduate Site Reliability Engineer at <a href="https://www.xero.com/nz/">Xero</a> but it hasn&rsquo;t officially started since I&rsquo;m still on my way to the airport.</p>

<p>I told myself that when I finally got my first full time development position, I&rsquo;d write a big post mortem about how long it took, how many times I was rejected and all that but since I haven&rsquo;t (yet), this is my offering to the Content Overlords.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if I actually slept last night because it felt like most of it was like &ldquo;Oh no, what have I actually learnt over the last year&rdquo; and other rude things from that pesky doubtful voice we all have.</p>

<p>Excuse me, you silly voice, I&rsquo;ll have you know that I&rsquo;ve used and/or fiddled with ahem</p>

<p>and let me tell you, MediaWiki is something&hellip; special alright but it&rsquo;s solid!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be silly of course to think that somehow knowing a bunch of frameworks and languages will somehow mean I&rsquo;m set for life because that&rsquo;s nonsense talk. It&rsquo;s all about knowing picking the right tool for the right job, y&rsquo;know?</p>

<p>One of the things I&rsquo;d like to do more this year is reading more about actual software stories. I started reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreaming_in_Code">Dreaming in Code</a> earlier this year which seems to be a &ldquo;what not to do&rdquo; manua. The author, Scott Rosenberg often veers so far into tangents that half the book feels more like a history lesson than development but that&rsquo;s good! Software won&rsquo;t save you, or the planet, on its own. You gotta focus on the people behind it and getting them working together as a proper team.</p>

<p>This post isn&rsquo;t actually about anything as you can tell. It&rsquo;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a> of posts. Well, that&rsquo;s not true since Seinfeld isn&rsquo;t actually about nothing, it&rsquo;s just a show without drama. It&rsquo;s supposed to just be regular life because your average person doesn&rsquo;t live out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City">Sex in the City</a> on the daily basis. I&rsquo;ve never actually seen that show though, it&rsquo;s just used as a punchline a lot.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure if I look back at today, I&rsquo;ll wonder what I was even worried about. If you think about friends or coworkers, do you even really remember meeting them? It&rsquo;s like as soon as you properly know someone, you just kinda forget any awkward moments before your first interaction. I suppose it&rsquo;s like that with jobs. You just kinda turn up one day and, assuming you try your best, you just kinda slot in nicely as if you&rsquo;d been there the whole time.</p>

<p>Anyway, I better deploy this thing before my taxi gets here. It&rsquo;s still kinda crazy to me that I can just give away the <a href="https://github.com/marcus-crane/site/blob/95ae742bbf33662f4dd4cf284e463d0f9320c8d1/site/posts/blog/2018/2018-02-12-day-xero.md">actual post file</a> you&rsquo;re reading with a few entries into a terminal. Yes, I had to manually make that link because this post even in the repo yet! That&rsquo;s like some kinda preemptive sharing, whoaaa mannnnn.</p>

<p>As someone who learnt piece by piece, pouring a bunch of hours into Right Click -&gt; View Page Source, it&rsquo;s nice to give my own stuff back. I can&rsquo;t remember who said it or when but someone once said something along the lines of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t write code, I merely borrow it.&rdquo; Their point wasn&rsquo;t that they spend all day on Stack Overflow but rather that none of their ideas are truly original. Nothing is original because it&rsquo;s all inspired by things that came before.</p>

<p>Ok, ok, my time is actually almost up and while I&rsquo;m a bit freaked out that I&rsquo;ll be diving into my first full time software job after years of being a hobbyist, there&rsquo;s one thing that I try to remind myself. I might not truly know what I&rsquo;m doing but neither does anyone else.</p>

<p>As someone else once told me:</p>
